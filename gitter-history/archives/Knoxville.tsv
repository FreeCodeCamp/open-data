We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying ‚Äúhello‚Äù and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We‚Äôve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you‚Äôd like.
Here‚Äôs a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

Not sure how far you've gotten, but I just got to the ""Basic Algorithm Scripting"" bonfires and I'm completely lost or stupid. Not sure which, but if anyone in the community could help, I'd buy you a beer or coffee."

I stumbled across FreeCodeCamp about a month back and after traveling back from China to Tennessee / getting access to a stable internet connection, I'm ready to dive into coding. I've been a graphic designer and photographer for some time now, but I'm excited to start over again and see where these challenges can take me.
