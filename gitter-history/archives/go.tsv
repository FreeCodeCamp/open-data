When I split a package into multiple files, go build should automatically discover all files and statically link them, right?

I'm doing the tour at [exercise: loops and functions ](https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/8). I understand the basic math behind doing this but resorted to peeking at other answers. I picked one to deconstruct and I do not understand what is happening at a certain part of the code. Here's the code:
```go
package main
import (
    ""fmt""
    ""math""
)
func Sqrt(x float64) float64 {
    t, z := 0., 1.
    for {
        z, t = z - (z*z-x)/(2*z), z
        if math.Abs(t-z) < 1e-8 {
            break
        }
    }
    return z
}
func main() {
    i := 169.
    fmt.Println(Sqrt(i))
}
```
The portion I do not understand is `  z, t = z - (z*z-x)/(2*z), z`. When I read that statement I see two lines: 
```go
z  =  z - (z*z-x)/(2*z)
t  =  z
```
But if I change it the function breaks. Any thoughts?"

But I saw many golang code where people use exported names, for example in separate file (but still in the main package) they define some exported struct with both exported and not exported methods.

They just have the handler for viewing pages check if the page was found then return an error if it wasn't. Can you have another handler specified in http.HandleFunc() that will return an error and get called if any of the other functions 'fall through' by not writing to the responseWriter?

Its about using the graphql language for schema creation. Until now, the graphql language gets used often to write down schemas fast, but you specify them in golang what is a kinda messy and long code with a lot of specifications.
Using the graphql language itself for creating the golang specifications is shorter and more readable. (Thats what i'm doing there)"

Now I have a Cassandra DB and I have created another go file where I made connection to the DB which is returning me the gocql.Session struct. Now my question is how can I use the same gocql.Session in all the services (multiple go source file with different package) ?

For both sending cases & receiving cases! But it if I close a channel and try to send to it, it will panic.

Assume we have passed a channel to a goroutine. How can we set that channel to `nil`? (a best practice/recommendation - pointer? struct field? something else?) Because setting a channel to nil provides far more interesting semantic than closing a channel."

It has it's perks to do it like that right from the begining. You'll already have API for mobile apps, or simply if you want to change your site later, it will be way easier. I personally prefer Ember for full featuerd framework, or Vue.js for more lightweight components approach. Didn't really jump on React bandwagon yet :-D

56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-04-16T16:41:28.358Z	55a225235e0d51bd787b1c50	stefanjarina	57126b383ddb73ba105cb119	Like I'm not saying that it is not possible to write full app in Go, it just was not pleasure for me to write it.
56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-04-16T16:40:46.704Z	55a225235e0d51bd787b1c50	stefanjarina	57126b0e548df1be102d8349	Or you can do Go + Angular/Ember/Backbone/React+Flux/Vue+vuex, etc.
56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-04-16T16:38:43.316Z	55a225235e0d51bd787b1c50	stefanjarina	57126a93af4636103865245d	@miguelmejiamontes I've attempted to write full app in Go, but to be honest I was diagusted by the web frameworks available for Go. It is great for microservices and APIs but for full site development I don't know. I personaly prefer Elixir and Phoenix Framework for full featured web app. Or Rails, or Django.

Go is perfect for writing microservice API's but I've never written a full app in it
56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-04-13T21:05:04.176Z	56ce0e46e610378809c34a4b	alpox	570eb4805ed5a4fd3fe2c28f	@stefanjarina I have a macbook but i don't like it so much for programming. The best programming environment is still my linux :-) except i'm programming with C# (visual studio)

56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-04-13T16:52:48.444Z	56ce0e46e610378809c34a4b	alpox	570e7960b30cfa0f384b125c	I just don't like windows so much anymore (Well its great for games though) but its still much slower than my linux

56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-04-13T16:51:40.163Z	55a225235e0d51bd787b1c50	stefanjarina	570e791c3ddb73ba105bbb0b	yeah, I am mostly in Windows nowadays, because of games. + I have enough of linux at work, and usually when I program something web related I just connect to my server and program in vim - there is great support for Elixir as well as Golang
56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-04-13T16:50:37.467Z	55a225235e0d51bd787b1c50	stefanjarina	570e78ddb30cfa0f384b122a	depends on what you want to log, usually app is smart enough by default, but there are also modules for monitoring as far as I know

56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-04-13T16:40:09.793Z	55a225235e0d51bd787b1c50	stefanjarina	570e7669548df1be102c8ea3	or rather about handling them, they still care about errors they can see on logs, but there is just no point in handling it, if Supervisor will just restart to new process
56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-04-13T16:39:52.404Z	56ce0e46e610378809c34a4b	alpox	570e76585cd40114649af420	And i wonder why other languages don't have something like that ^^

56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-04-13T16:39:22.976Z	55a225235e0d51bd787b1c50	stefanjarina	570e763a4c2125fc3f020dc2	so it can't affect other users

56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-04-13T16:32:44.432Z	56ce0e46e610378809c34a4b	alpox	570e74acaf463610386432b3	Yeah thats true. I never did a lot in Ruby.

It is best for http APIs where it can handle hell lot of connections. Or you can use socket approach, where your application will connect to Go server app via socket and it keeps open connection and communicate inside the socket

It can only handle one thread though unless you spawn multiple processes. .NET is great on windows servers and its TOP libraries like Entity Framework etc... 
Golang is one of the fastest and provides good API possibility - i would set it next to NodeJS whereas you may still use NodeJS for task runners. What it can do better over Node is its concurrency model (Easy, readable async code), and its a compiled language what may or may not fit you.

I'm new to Go myself.
Not sure if this is the place to ask this question, but - 

I'm trying to calculate the time 10 minutes ago.
Why can't I do this calculation with variables (usable for a for loop).

See - 
`
package main
import (
	""fmt""
	""time""
)

func main() {

	// the time now
	fmt.Println(time.Now())
	
	// the time 50 minutes ago - WORKS
	diff := (60 - 10) * time.Minute
	newTime := time.Now().Add(-diff)
	fmt.Println(newTime)
	
	// the time 50 minutes ago - DOESN'T WORKS!
	i := 10
	diff = (60 - i) * time.Minute
	newTime = time.Now().Add(-diff)
	fmt.Println(newTime)
}`

This is the error I'm getting - 
>prog.go:20: invalid operation: (60 - i) * time.Minute (mismatched types int and time.Duration)

Elixir is based on ruby syntax running in erlang virtual machine. Which is used for about 70℅ of telco ibfrastructure. If you now make a call, there 70% chance thatbitbis routed via erlang program. It is functional and fault tolerant. So fault tolerant that some people couldn't kill linux server, because erlang app refused to die :-D functional programming is in my opinion harder for a novice programer.

56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-03-06T15:48:09.248Z	55658f2715522ed4b3e0ff82	dc0d	56dc5139ddfe3d4316281afc	Pleas don't laugh! I use both at the same time! I'm a 80% backend 20% frontend dev!

56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-03-06T15:44:33.141Z	55a225235e0d51bd787b1c50	stefanjarina	56dc5061b0cc3f1b41507da3	for that case, it is probably the best, most feature rich

56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-03-06T15:42:43.511Z	55a225235e0d51bd787b1c50	stefanjarina	56dc4ff3ddfe3d4316281ac7	I never use multiple folders, so not sure here

We want to help build our campers those 5 applications and 5 micro-services using Go.

We also plan on adding challenges, like we have for JS, to hone their skills in Go.

But for now, we are focused on creating articles on [FCC Wiki](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki) to help our campers start the back-end projects in Go."

Just to be clear, we are looking for some contribution in Go curriculum, so that our other campers can get a sense of direction.

56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-03-03T08:06:12.223Z	55a225235e0d51bd787b1c50	stefanjarina	56d7f0749b722b537d1920a4	Go is just great for command line application where you can't be sure you have runtime on target system -- so just compile app to single binary and scp it to machine and you're done.
56d55897e610378809c460bf	FreeCodeCamp/go	2016-03-03T08:05:36.268Z	55a225235e0d51bd787b1c50	stefanjarina	56d7f05006ba9a282a28c56a	let's say I am hobyist (don't have job in programming [at least yet :-D]) so never used it professionaly, but I am working in it for year or so... Primarily using it for toolsmithing.

Really pleasure to work with it. If you need something more robust (Rails/Django like) then I can recommend Beego.
