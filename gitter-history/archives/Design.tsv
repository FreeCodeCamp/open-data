I initially planned to have it finished much earlier, but I had to postpone it due to the ongoing work on the Inspector panel which was requested by many users.

How many months will it take before a public release, I don't know. It could be ready, it could take another year, I don't know.

I am on OSX and will take a look at other programs. Inkscape...was...ok. I'm sure I'll run into some thing or other when it's time to print 😂! Thanks for the help.

55c58de30fc9f982beaca7dd	FreeCodeCamp/Design	2016-06-21T13:53:39.420Z	546ccc51db8155e6700d634d	SangSatori	576946e32554bbe049ba0cd9	Hey @carlosvigil - for scaling purposes, I think a vector editor is a better choice. It's possible to pull off that stuff with Inkscape and some self-discipline regarding the organization of layers & details of elements; you can then export the end result as an SVG or PDF file for printing. The interface and whole user experience is IMHO much inferior to that of Illustrator, but I still use it a lot. If you are on OS X, commercial software like Sketch or Affinity Designer could be a good choice too.
55c58de30fc9f982beaca7dd	FreeCodeCamp/Design	2016-06-19T00:20:17.402Z	56fea76c187bb6f0eadd6636	carlosvigil	5765e541a82a6b0079a6e477	"Hey, all,
wondering what software I should use to edit/overlay some text over an image for print as stickers. I’d normally use something like photoshop or gimp, but I remembered how simple vectors are on Illustrator and thought that might be better

I don’t have any of that software anymore, so that’s why I’m asking, which would be best?"

I didn't think about the limitations before, so now I'll play around with other methods of centering. It's still crazy to me that in 2015, it's so hard to center things! I first played with CSS in the late '90s, and it feels as if little progress has been made in that department. ;)

Obviously if your text is too long you'll still have problems.  You could give the text container a max and do something with the overflow?

It just all falls apart a bit on mobile, depending on the device. I don't suppose in general anyone has suggestions for where I can learn about responsive design best practices? I feel as if I may be making this harder on myself than need be. (I don't want to use frameworks like Bootstrap until I understand responsive design better. I don't want to depend on a framework without understanding what it's doing and how.) http://i.imgur.com/olV3vbs.png
55c58de30fc9f982beaca7dd	FreeCodeCamp/Design	2015-08-08T16:46:52.133Z	55c5980a0fc9f982beaca83b	meowwwls	55c6327caac97ada66dd225f	@Rybar  Thank you! That's what I feared. I was hoping to get the effect that as long as the window was wide enough, it would always show that each section took up half of of the vh, no matter how much content was on each. I love how uniform it looks, vs the height being auto and based on the amount of content in each section. I've seen it work for others, but they only had maybe 2-3 lines of text in each section, so even when the window was made quite small, it still looked fine. I played around with it a bit more now with fresh eyes and was able to meet myself halfway: I kept the height at 50vh, but added a minimum height so that the content always has enough room. That way when the window is large enough, I get the effect I want, but when it's smaller, it still looks good without the content spilling out. Of course this all goes to hell on mobile. I'll keep playing with it. It seems to be the simple things that trip me up with responsive design. As for you commenting out the **top/transform** for the text wrapper,  do you have any suggestions for how to center the text vertically without using that method? I want it centered vertically no matter the amount of text nor the height of the container, and that's the only method that worked, even though as you saw, it pushes the content off the page if the window gets too small.

The content spills out because 50vh of a  200px screen is 100px.. and because it's hard-set the content flows out.

I hope it's OK if I get this started with asking for a bit of help! Google is failing me this time, perhaps because it's hard to describe the issue I'm having. I'm trying to use vh to dictate the height of my sections. It works wonderfully when the window is large enough. However, when the window shrinks, the content has nowhere to go. Whereas with an auto height the sections would just expand to fit the content, the content is spilling out of my sections and overlapping. It's a mess! Also, because of my method of centering vertically, when the window is resized and content starts to spill out, it also jumps off the top off the page. And as if that isn't enough, the last section - when the page is resized - does not reach the bottom of the page. The content spills out onto the body.  http://codepen.io/LuEm/pen/rVROqr Does anyone have any idea what the heck I'm doing wrong? Here's a couple of screenshots of what's happening http://i.imgur.com/OoPcbZ9.png http://i.imgur.com/u4O5qvA.png
