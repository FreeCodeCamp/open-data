We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

Both the Milwaukee and Madison rooms aren’t super active yet, so I can only imagine that geographic regions with smaller populations would have fewer meet ups. But you could try starting a group for southern wi and see if you get any response.

There are several good-sounding MKE-area developer meetup groups (I've attended exactly 0 of them, though, so who really knows).

But there only ended up being three of us. So I'm not sure if there are enough people to support a separate Madison group yet. But then again, we might not know if we don't try!
