# Hi campers. We are archiving the LocalLeaders room and moving everyone over to our new [Contributors](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors) room.

There are several reasons why we're doing this:
1. it will facilitate more cross-discipline collaboration 
2. it will give everyone a better idea of what contributors are working on
3. it will be more lively (and chat should be lively)

We will archive this public room in a few days, close it, then release the message history of this (and hundreds of other archived rooms) as open data. 

So join me over here: https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors"

Unpaid work may not be the best idea, but it may provide experience and portfolio pieces... and perhaps turn into a paid position in some cases.

We’re building an app for our meetup to help people pair but at the moment its dependant on people entering stuff manually. Is there an API or is it just that Top 100 one that is on one of the challenges?

That would be a site listing people doing FCC track in London their level in the track ..so which challenge are on ..and user can filter them by sessions of the FCC track. For the moment I develope I quick mock...just frontend really ...you can have a look at http://artitudinale.org.uk/FCCLND/app/#/.  I have shared with campers and I hope to collaborate with them to make the idea grow. I used FCC logo as well...if I'm not allow pls let me know...but in this case it seems to me to be part of the FCC brand. To reconnect to what @chris-alexander  was saying in last post we could even use some API from FCC integrating with our code to update campers profile...as last challenge or last update on the FCC track. Here as well the repo for the idea https://github.com/artitudinale1/FCCLND/ if some others leaders are curious or willing to do similar project. Feedback are more than welcome ! :)

The purpose of the homepage would be to showcase the work of each local campsite's members along with links their github and freecodecamp profiles. It could eventually help to figure out where members are on the curriculum for Pair Programming at coffee-and-codes. I was also thinking that members could use it to show that they've collaborated on a project early on (i.e. with PRs to the repo for the campesite's page). Just an idea really rather than a request. I know everyone is pretty busy with the curriculum etc.

If not, we'll just keep looking for a venue that can host our Coffee & Code sessions consistently (currently its uncertain where we'll be each week).

If it can help to clearfy situation - here text of their proposal: 
 
	Hi Alex,
	Hope all's well and apologies for the delay in getting back to you. 
	The good news is that we would love to host FreeCodeCamp at CodeNode. One of our active community members gave us a very good reference for this initiative. Please have a read of the following guidelines which meetups meeting at CodeNode follow:

	How We Work
	All events are organised for and by our community. We provide all our members with free space and marketing support to help grow groups and communities. To support and sponsor your group, we’ll just need your members to join the Skills Matter community by signing up online. Most groups also use external platforms to promote their events but direct registrations through skillsmatter.com
	All Meet-up groups have their own page on our website: https://skillsmatter.com/groups.
	Every event also has its own dedicated event page and is searchable (through relevant tags) as part of our upcoming event listings. This helps create awareness of your group, topics and events amongst our 60,000+ members.
	We are proud of hosting multiple meetups at CodeNode every evening connecting attendees with other amazing people in our community, introducing them to other relevant groups or events, supporting and developing ideas and skills.

	Creating valuable community content
	Every meetup is filmed and published online as a 'SkillsCast' video including the film and slides. All videos are tagged to help users navigate and find relevant meetups or SkillsCasts.

	Delegate contact details
	Due to data protection, we are not able to share delegate details with any third parties including meet-up organisers. We take responsibility for communicating important messages and updates to your members through Skills Matter.

	Scheduling your meetups
	To make sure we can always accommodate your event, we ask meetup organisers to pre-schedule a fixed date at least 6-8 weeks in advance to avoid disappointment. Of course if you have a sudden requirement for a different date, we'll do everything we can to make it happen.

	If all the above sounds good, please send me your group's description along with a logo and I will book the space for you.
	Looking forward to hearing from you. Have a cracking weekend."

565ded3516b6c7089cbced2a	FreeCodeCamp/LocalLeaders	2016-04-09T17:38:58.720Z	551fe9f815522ed4b3de58e9	chris-alexander	57093e328b7b2f457635239f	@hallaathrad @SaintPeter  thanks for the feedback. :) We've reached out to another organisation here in London called Skills Matter who seem to be willing to host us but we are a little concerned because they want to list us on their site with our (the FCC) logo and record the meet ups showing the footage on their site. Do you know if it will be okay to use the logo or should we have a modified version which identifies us as the London Campsite?

I think it has to do with the fact that one of them would have to volunteer to come over the weekend (which is when we host our local events here in Toronto)

this sort of events are intended as a way to make something difficult (learning to code) less painful. Thus,  keeping it informal and casual makes it extremely effective. Think of a bunch of friends hanging out together, but instead of alcohol, there’s code ;) haha"

CodeCamp, this afternoon, Quincy had just mentioned the 'g+m' hot key combo for opening the course map.  So I tried it, and selected the last challenge I completed.  Instead of displaying the 3 panes, left to right, of instructions, work area, and handheld display, each section was full-screen, pushing the others off the screen, downward.  With my disabilities, it's harder to work, when I can't see the three areas, side by side, at once.

I like that I'm getting exposed to HTML 4.0, which we aren't using in my college class.  And I do want to be familiar with how to code my web comic site so it looks good on tiny screens.

I'm not any kind of leader there, so far.  And I've been attending the Hack RVA workshop club for over 3 years.  I'm regarded as a strong member, but have a limited coding background.  I did code my own web comic site, in raw HTML 2.0, about 6 or 7 years ago.

I started a freeCodeCamp two months ago.  And I also started meetup here in Chicago, we've had two meetups.  During the first one, eight people showed.  It was pretty unorganized,  we mostly discussed random topics and agreed to get to the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges for the next meetup in two weeks.   Last week during the second meetup, 14 people showed up.  We broke up into groups of 2 to 4 people and worked on challenges together.  I think the breaking up and working together is a good format for the meetups.  Does anyone have any advice or ideas for future meetups?   Like I said, I'm new to all this and would greatly appreciate any advice.  Thanks.

I told them I will post every day eg:coding challenge day 1. Then once people have done their coding for the day, they need to 'like' the post. I will keep a tally and give one point for each like. If somebody does more than one hour then they need to comment on the post with 'I did over an hour of code today!' Etc.. Then they will get an extra point for the day. Each week I will post the top 5 campers leading the challenge. At 30 days we will announce the winner of the challenge and we will go out for a dinner celebration (and treat the winner!). Let's see how it goes!😁😁😁

Do you by any chance know whether she is running this event as herself or through another organisation? I believe (without feeling informed enough to say this with certainty), if it is an event coordinated by or in the name of FCC, it should remain a free event, or MAYBE receive donations to cover logistic expenses. The policy for this whole organisation is from, by and towards non-profit ideas. 

This said, if this event —which granted promotes a great cause— is being created/hosted with FCC as a sponsor, it makes senses for members of the sponsoring organisation to receive perks… usually translatable into at the very least free admitance. I run events for two very popular tech organisations here in Toronto, which give this as an expected benefit to their sponsors’ members.

Anyone else, non-campers, are free range I’d say. 

But @QuincyLarson is right in saying that “no monney exchanges hands” is one of the main very few conditions of making part of one of our campsites.

However. There’s also the fact that each campsite is a micro-community, and it is seen as the members all chipping in, rather than paying a fee, that may be a different story.

I guess it’s as always not in what you say but in how"

I wanted to get your thoughts on this idea, with respect to our principle of money not changing hands among campers within the context of campsite events.

Now I am waiting to see if it works well. I like the idea of letting people join in later (no need for everyone to start on the same day) so a chat room might work well. A 30 day challenge is a good idea too. Maybe more realistic :smile:  I often heard people say that it takes 21 days for something to become a habit, so 30 days is great.

We want to have somewhere for people to update on their progress every day. Facebook is not ideal, unless we create a whole new group for that. Any other suggestions on how we might do this?

We were chatting and think we want to use this one group in Facebook for both cities. Can you create it  on the wiki 'Jeddah women only campsite' and link it to the same Facebook page as Riyadh women campsite OR perhaps just one 'Saudi Arabia women' campsite. (?) The reason we just want one group is that we have very little experienced women and want to work together.

We met up in a mall that has a special ejckosed area for ladies with free wifi. We were 3 ladies and our kids! It was really great to be coding together and helping each other! We are all mums and brought our kids too! Kids were playing with playdoh, reading stories, making paperjets and building with Lego! We all had a great time. 😊😊😊

This might not be the best place to post this but hopefully it will be noticed by the right people who are working on redesigning the website. I suggest that a progression bar should be added in the map section, so you can easily spot if there is a waypoint/checkpoint/bonefire that you might have missed. Previously there was one, and it should be great if it would be introduced again. Sections like ""Basic JavaScript"" can be very long, and it can be very easy to overlook an uncompleted entry. Other than that, the new look is pretty :)"

Some people are willing to travel, others cannot or will not.

Yesterday I asked the local group to start thinking about which parts of Seattle made sense for having it's own regular meetings and regular organizers, e.g., West Seattle (which has a lot of interest), Ballard (which has probably the most activity).
565ded3516b6c7089cbced2a	FreeCodeCamp/LocalLeaders	2016-01-06T08:07:49.160Z	546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c	QuincyLarson	568ccb55e8598dd060155985	@denmch yes, like @hallaathrad said, our goal is to have campsites at the neighborhood level. For example, in the Bay Area, there are probably 10 different areas that have at least 100,000 people living in them, who could easily commute to events after work.

I'm not the organizing/talking to big groups type, but I'm keen to make sure there's good communication and outreach going forward.

Perhaps you can organise subgroups that way and it'll make things easier to parce by local areas...

We were just talking with quincy a few minutes ago about how groups grow and start sort of splinting into smaller, more local groups. It is great to see you getting such turn-up, and I'd love to hear how you've managed to develop so succesfully.

I'm wondering how people in large cities manage and coordinate things. Seattle has passed 500 members, but most of the activity is centered in just a couple of small, separately run groups.

More hangouts though. One every Sunday, Saturday and then some spontaneously. Not all of them planned in advance. For the first one, we had 2 show up. The second one 3, fourth 5 and so on. Our last meetup was with 8 people.
565ded3516b6c7089cbced2a	FreeCodeCamp/LocalLeaders	2015-12-20T10:35:32.857Z	54c376d0db8155e6700f08c6	Shauky	56768474f99ceb846ae6cdc6	We are also offering free ebooks, peer lessons and one-on-one coding, not just with FCC, but anything JavaScript related that they might want to work on. Right now, the regular group is very enthusiastic and we chat back and forth everyday. That rapport is important for us.

One idea was to get a permanent venue. We are working on that now. And have been given a good offer by a local Ngo. In return for promising community bootcamps using FCC lessons.
565ded3516b6c7089cbced2a	FreeCodeCamp/LocalLeaders	2015-12-20T10:32:07.937Z	54c376d0db8155e6700f08c6	Shauky	567683a737169e856a75ad56	@QuincyLarson  I also chat frequently in the facebook group. A seperate chat for those who attend at least one hangout and one for the whole group.  Even though we have more than 60 members, usually only 10-12 people respond to the chats in the main group and 5 repond constructively. So I'm keeping that going.

We had to keep the first comers interested while making others comfortable. We spoke to the management at a good cafe where everyone felt at ease and that's been solved
565ded3516b6c7089cbced2a	FreeCodeCamp/LocalLeaders	2015-12-20T10:26:56.171Z	54c376d0db8155e6700f08c6	Shauky	5676827037169e856a75ad3f	@QuincyLarson I had to take a break due to travel last month, and the camp went without a meet up for two weeks. In hindsight it was bad that I couldnt get momentum built up early on. But I'm trying to make up for that. I've added an admin who is more seasoned than me now. I've pretty much given him control over when to hold meet ups, where, getting new people on board and deciding what to do next in the group.

565ded3516b6c7089cbced2a	FreeCodeCamp/LocalLeaders	2015-12-17T07:58:17.769Z	54c376d0db8155e6700f08c6	Shauky	56726b19f31bbe91555af18d	@razat249, going through the material on FCC by itself is a huge task. If newcomers concentrate on the first lessons, its always better for them in the end. When I tried them I spent as much time as I could to understand the Mozilla documentation. Then fielded their questions. You really don't need any other resource at the early stages. I also think introducing them to glitter and showing them around hekped. Because that's how you keep moving forward.

Our first coffee and code was about sitting down and getting newcomers on board. We just set to completing the first lessons upto the first set of bonfires. Helped each other out.

The best is probably ScreenHero, but at this time you need someone to invite you to join it - if you want to PM me your e-mail address I can invite you, then you can invite someone else and so on.  For Linux the alternative is TeamViewer, but it's not quite as nice.

Which turned out into a conversation about creating a simple app for that. The idea for the app: promise future coffees, like or give props to that persons profile. Leaderboard for most props given, coffees promised or gained, lessons completed via peer hangouts. Working on it now.

We have about 150 members, we get 6-12 for our meetups.  I am hopeful that with my increased direct engagement that more people will come out to my future events.  I am personally messaging every new member that joins our FB group and then on a weekly basis posting the names (via `@FacebookName`) of new members welcoming them to our group.  Sort of a weekly ""invitation thread""."

I think I'm going to stick to FB. People can get onto gitter and chat/ask. I have 30 ppl and 5 have responded to tomorrow's meetup. I'm happy even if one comes!

I was thinking of also building a website for our group. My goal was mostly to build it as a group project and adding more functionality to the site as our needs and skills grow.

Is that a normal ratio? Is there a good way to shore up participation, aside from recruiting more people?

With a smaller group a whats app idea is not that bad, with a larger group it starts being difficult to manage, but You can always promote a few people to admins :) So basically it all depends on the group.

For a later ones we had a camper with a membership to a local hackerspacer - we've been meeting there since.  We've also recently started doing ""Coffee 'n Code"", which are just at a local group-friendly resuraunt."

Just because You do not have such a culture, does not mean You cannot start a trend :)  Hmm maybe ask in the group if they want to make a small project together, and then rebrand the meetups as project meetings :)

I got one person to respond to show up for the first meetup. But then something good happened, people sitting around us started taking notice and we got people interested in the next one. So when even one person shows up it just picks you up. This first guy is still coming to every meetup, I wouldn't want to lose him.
