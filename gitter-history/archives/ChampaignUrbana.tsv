We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.

I'm mostly helping create some new curriculum, the 'hikes' that are short CS videos. My main focus is getting those scripted and filmed now so when they launch the mobile curriculum I can get more videos out

And then I picked up again over the summer. I also went to the coffee coder meetup group. That meets at  pizza m in Urbana. One of the guys from it recomended it to me. He works for github or digital ocean. I think it  was digital ocean
