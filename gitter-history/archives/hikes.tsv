# Hi campers. We are archiving the Hikes room and moving everyone over to our new [Contributors](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors) room.

There are several reasons why we're doing this:
1. it will facilitate more cross-discipline collaboration 
2. it will give everyone a better idea of what contributors are working on
3. it will be more lively (and chat should be lively)

We will archive this public room in a few days, close it, then release the message history of this (and hundreds of other archived rooms) as open data. 

So join me over here: https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors"

I think if it's unicode it will show up well on both FCC and on YouTube.

We will actually need to re-upload these as Free Code Camp's YouTube channel - otherwise they won't be associated with our channel - just with a playlist.

Also, the camera is zoomed in on your upper body, which means everything is quite big, which will be perfect for smaller mobile screens.
55ea1cee0fc9f982beafb358	FreeCodeCamp/hikes	2016-09-16T19:48:33.466Z	5599c58915522ed4b3e36de3	SEGrooms	57dc4c9127a8458f7f1f6b6f	I haven’t updated it yet. I recorded it roughly 20 minutes ago. Partitioning the videos ended up being more challenging than I originally thought.

I felt like the set operators video didn't sufficiently introduce them. You could do them and use a Venn Diagram to illustrate them.

I don't want to believe them. But you always have to keep in mind - only a small percentage of the human brain is dedicated to processing abstract concepts - most of it is focused on observing. For example, there's a huge portion of the brain dedicated just to processing human faces. So facial expressions can convey a lot of information.

But we should still do everything we can to keep them watching.

This only takes a moment, but it can reinforce meaning to the learner.

A big part of standing in front of the whiteboard is presence. People like looking at people. That's how information was communicated for thousands of years - by one person standing there talking to you, diagramming something with a stick in the dirt or on a wall as a crude visual aid. It is possibly hard-wired into our brains, which is why lecturing in front of a whiteboard/chalk board is essentially universal across cultures."

Herbert Gross's presence is incredible. He's so clear and deliberate with what he chooses to say and in what sequence he covers various considerations. You can tell he's really passionate about differential equations and actively practices, too.

Each have their distinct advantages. With the **white board**, you can more easily sell the material to students, which is important for **abstract concepts**. With **screencasting**, you can give **live recordings aplications**. The white board should only be used for live recordings when talking about something like mock white board interviews.

So, **to summarize, if it is written on a board, you MUST have everythin written prior to recording.**
55ea1cee0fc9f982beafb358	FreeCodeCamp/hikes	2016-09-10T14:39:32.250Z	5599c58915522ed4b3e36de3	SEGrooms	57d41b24d274dbdf3506c694	Herbert seems pretty awkward talking into the camera, but I’m assuming that is due to recorded lectures being a fairly new concept. Although his voice seems unnatural, he gives *exceptionally* concise lectures on the subject. I believe this is because he already wrote the material on the board, and therefore already rehearsed everything he is going explain. He also has all of his notes in front of him, which gives him confidence throughout the video. And finally, he is quite relaxed, which is probably from years of lecturing. Since everyone contributing to video challenges hasn’t been teaching for years, having the notes on the board will help them relax as well allow the students to easily follow along.

I was skeptical, but trusted her 8 years of teaching experience. At the time I started recording my original videos, I was taking a course on differential equations. I struggled with a certain topic and watched a video by Herbert Gross.

Chrome recently updated the look of the DevTools section, which I think may have made those old Dev Tools videos look somewhat dated. This is one reason why we should be conservative about using actual screencasts in conceptual videos.

But I wondered if that was actually the optimal way. So I spent a few hours doing some research and here's what I found out:

There are no widely cited papers focused on the efficacy of lecturing in YouTube videos. 

I conducted a Twitter poll 
https://twitter.com/ossia/status/774077365014061056

I asked on Quora question: https://www.quora.com/Which-format-works-best-for-short-YouTube-lectures-drawing-on-a-whiteboard-or-using-a-slide-deck-with-a-green-screen

(I'm a fan of whiteboarding, so I hope I didn't somehow bias the responses with the way I worded these questions.)

I also went through a ranked list of educational youtube channels and found no correlation behind their approach and production values and their results (views, subscribers). Here are some examples:

The New Boston (1m subscribers - screencast): https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston

Khan Academy (2.5m subscribers - digital whiteboard): https://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy

Programming Knowledge (250k subscribers - screencast): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs6nmQViDpUw0nuIx9c_WvA

Computerphile (650k subscribers - talking and writing stuff down on paper): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jKylhJtPmI

MIT Open Courseware (1m subscribers - standing at the whiteboard): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw3ccgYhFis&index=5&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oTpyxCMLKt_JmB0WtSZfG

My conclusions: 
- production value doesn't seem to matter (none of the top educational channels used green screens or fancy visual effects)
- the presentation doesn't have to be perfect - far from it. The more natural and casual it seems, the better.
- the quality of content seems to be the main thing that matters."

Hopefully I can get to things before then, but that day I will definitely make time. :watch:

My only comment is that I have 10 scripts, but I haven’t figured out how I’m going to partition them into separate videos yet. I figured I would see how much material I cover in a video, and make adjustments as necessary.

I figured you would prefer mass progress with an apology over updates with minimal progress. So for these 3 units, I ask that you please just trust me, and tell me where to send videos. In regards to future scripts, I will return to using GitHub for scripts.
55ea1cee0fc9f982beafb358	FreeCodeCamp/hikes	2016-07-08T14:07:38.757Z	5599c58915522ed4b3e36de3	SEGrooms	577fb3aa3eaf66535e4baf5a	@atjonathan  @QuincyLarson I will complete the 3rd unit on logic today and begin recording tomorrow. The recording will be quick, as I’m following the scripts verbatim. This will be essential for deaf campers, ELL, and allows easier adjustments in the future. I also bought a white board, so I won’t have to run to my local library anymore, which will save a lot of time. When those videos recorded, editing will be minimal, and it is definitely enough material to publish on FCC.
55ea1cee0fc9f982beafb358	FreeCodeCamp/hikes	2016-07-08T14:05:25.581Z	5599c58915522ed4b3e36de3	SEGrooms	577fb3251ca34a944ec57ab5	@atjonathan  @QuincyLarson 3 days ago, I outlined a very concise curriculum with the following units: Introduction, Sets, Logic, Counting (Combinatorics), Relations, Functions, and Recursion. This will lay a **solid** foundation for understanding topics in math & CS. In the issues I closed, I found topics that should be omitted due to the hike format and others I can’t believe I excluded! Put simply, I set a :bomb: off on my previous material, as I was ashamed that it wasn’t my best work. Apparently this stuff is way easier when you aren’t studying 80-100hpw, go figure!! I’m progressing at an incredibly fast rate, and I’ll be going straight from scripting to recording. In 3 (4?) days, I've written scripts for 2 of the 7 units in my outline.

I'm now a moderator of the youtube channel, which means I can edit and upload videos directly. I'm gonna be working on the channel intro to start off with. I'm thinking of including an animation sorta promo, and also level up the production value. Tagging @brianamarie

We had created a `new/video-challenges` branch earlier in the process, but doesn't seem to have been maintained. I've been working on a new branch of current master on my own fork.

I've never struggled with that aspect because the camera I use was bought originally for its sound quality, but I imagine that many recording situations are more difficult.

My two recommendations are: read this post by @brianamarie https://medium.freecodecamp.com/let-s-go-for-a-hike-here-s-your-map-4301df6e3801#.antjbtft5 and use a white instead of a chalkboard. The chalk can make a mess on your laptop!

In order to have the laptop at the correct height, I place a small trash can upside-down on the table in the room. If the laptop still isn’t high enough, I can grab a few thick dictionaries off the shelves.

I don't think a laptop camera will be high enough quality. You'll want to use some sort of external camera. Even a rear-facing phone camera may be powerful enough.

I wouldn't worry about scripting down to specific words - I think @brianamarie creates talking points, records the video, then transcribes what she ultimately said in the video.

If you're still insistent on having them on your own channel, what I'd suggest doing is editing the video to put a disclaimer at the start saying something like ""This video was produced as a volunteer project for FreeCodeCamp. Please consider watching this video on their channel."" and include the link in both the annotation and video description. I'd also ensure that the title/description/tags of the video are fairly minimal (e.g. in your videos, don't mention FCC, hikes, and any FCC-unique terms) since you'll want to have the FCC version found over yours when people are searching. 

Or you can just make them all private and include a link to a playlist of private videos (not sure if you can do this, but you can figure that out for yourself)."

I'd have to think about having it be on your own account. The main reason I can think it wouldn't be a good idea is because we get detailed analytics from vimeo and YT on each video, and having some of those also uploaded on another account would make it difficult for those working with and getting that data.

Definitely doable, but for the sake of quickness for Saturday, is there a way I could just make a json file from scratch and get a hand creating challenge seed and id? I think that may save a lot of time in the short-future between now and saturday

I'm thinking ahead to the livestream saturday and the discussion/demo of hikes. Right now, I think the 'categories' that are ready are 'Computer Science Basics', 'The DOM', 'JavaScript Lingo', 'Chrome Dev Tools', and 'Big O Notation'. 
55ea1cee0fc9f982beafb358	FreeCodeCamp/hikes	2016-01-20T00:07:33.136Z	54aea2abdb8155e6700e788c	brianamarie	569ecfc5da358920486fb0f6	That's exactly the kind of information that would be very useful for users to know! Do you think this information would be good for a video challenge, or do you think there's another way that this could be shown/taught? I think this is an important aspect of web development that isn't well addressed in the current curriculum.

55ea1cee0fc9f982beafb358	FreeCodeCamp/hikes	2016-01-19T06:54:46.596Z	54cc87c6db8155e6700f4a66	erikasf	569dddb65de13b3f15e3df19	can i just step in and say, that there is a world of difference between ux and web design/development. they are two different specialties. it is because everyone automatically thinks that ux is just visual design with some css thrown in often . What ux is , is using cognitive psychology and observation to find the true needs and motivations of the user. it is finding the empathy and pain points that a person has and then helping to refine the focus of the user interface and actual site to fix that problem. UX designers work in collaboration with the web developers to bring out the solution in a  way that affords the least cognitive load and low barrier of entrance. it is the why before you ever use your web development skills to design the how.

55ea1cee0fc9f982beafb358	FreeCodeCamp/hikes	2016-01-10T02:23:32.594Z	54aea2abdb8155e6700e788c	brianamarie	5691c0a48fdd3c0c382dbb87	@dapperAuteur That's a fantastic question. I will have a chance to look at the repo in detail tomorrow, but a short answer is I don't know what I'm looking for in a difference. I don't know much about the differences associated with a UI/UX designer as opposed to a non-specific designer.

You should see it on github. I have a question about the UIUX Design/Development Hike. It sounds very similar to the Web Design vs Web Development Hike. How are they different? What are you looking for in the UIUX Hike that shouldn't be included in the Web Design vs Web Development Hike?

If they're self motivated (which users who reach this point generally are) they'll see they don't grasp the content and have a good reason to go back and re-watch the content if they feel it's necessary. At least in theory. :)

(F)  A lot of the questions are fine if you just make the answer True, but if creating a False solution they don't learn anything.

Content Delivery Networks are a service you can buy through your internet service provider to increase your network connectivity. (F, CDNs are not provided through ISPs, but are clients of websites that in turn use servers from an ISP to better deliver the content of the original website to the user).

CDNs are popular and wide-reaching, and you've probably used one as a website user many times without even knowing it. The end result is that your experience was faster than it could have been without the CDNs services. (T)"

Looked like a privacy concern. So i removed it. They keep it in their servers and what if it's hacked? All your secret urls are public. And that's too bad. :(

Just that they are awesome tool to use along with a list like the competency-matrix to judge where you are in certain skills.

Please create GitHub issues as ideas for hikes come into your mind. Here are the outstanding ones (including one I created a few hours ago): https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/labels/hikes

1. Come up with an idea for a hike (like the ones that @carl-parrish just listed off. Each of these should be a seperate hike and a seperate GitHub issue.
1. Create an issue on GitHub (https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/issues/new)
1. Give it a descriptive title
1. In the body, add links to any resources that you think our Hike could be based off of
1. Add the tag “Hikes”

Then someone can reply to the GitHub issue with a short script, along with any rough diagrams that could be drawn on the board.  We also need one to three true/false comprehension questions. Once we have feedback on that script, we can record it. We will close the issue once we have a link to the recorded HD video (youtube works fine for this - we will repost it to FCC’s Youtube and Vimeo)."

We have some visually impared campers who might be able to record a screencast about how they use their computers. @zersiax, for example, is quite a productive coder despite the fact that he was born blind.

Big O notation (O)n , Bubble vs Quick Sort,  S.O.L.I.D Principles, D.O.T (Do One Thing), D.R.Y (Don't Repeat Yourself) , Various Patterns and how to use them. Vagrant, Docker, (I feel that these has become as important as github to coding). Active Record, SQL vs NoSQL, Keyboard Short Cuts for VIM / Sublime / Atom / Webstorm. C.I. Servers, IDD (intent driven design), DDD (domain driven design). When developers talk these concepts come up a lot.

I'm working on a master list of current hikes that includes video links and script links, as well as a post with steps on how to create a hike. Hopefully this will help other campers get set up to create some that match the format if they're interested. It's not yet done, but I wanted to let you guys know that it's in the works

That’s around 20 concepts an hour, which is an amazing pace for learning things.

I personally think that the statistics may not be soo important for may of the campers at this level, but the algo part may certainly be a plus... what level of algorithm, I don't know... but there are already some for who things like the Sieve of Eratosthenes algo is a familiar one...

I hope you start the hikes soon. It'll be really fun learning. Also see that you start from complete basics. You don't need to go into complicated stuff at the start.

James has a background in math and physics, and has historically done most of his programming in FORTRAN. He’s working through Free Code Camp’s challenges on top of his graduate studies.

James has taught math to college students. And now he’s interested in teach math and science concepts to our campers by creating some hikes.

He’s watched many of @brianamarie’s hikes, and I hope that the two of them can talk soon about how he can go about recording some hikes."

It would be nice if they had some tools in their toolbox to better analyze and understand that.

However, one of the most important concepts of decomposition is removing redundancies. I also agree that it develops quite organically, but a short video could serve as a catalyst for pushing them in the right direction.

For example: `if(x > y || y > z) `  > are < are predicate symbols.  You use predicate logic when querying a database for a specific set,  every SQL query is an instance of predicate logic.

--- If you can plan your presentation from easy to difficult, with examples of use, and leaving the miscellaneous for the end instead (like informing that MDN  is a collaborative work by volunteers) could be better.
--- Maybe a short clarification of the symbols that accompany some of the methods, like Experimental, Deprecated, etc, could be somehow useful
--- Finally, teaching to use the search of the the MDN page (something that we are disregarding even here in the Gitter rooms) AND mentioning the use of the ""See also..."" section would be helpful. Just try yourself an example and do a search on MDN page for ""loop""... The problem is that it won't reveal any functional method..."

Some of the material is covered too shallowly - for example, for loops, which are integral to solving many Bonfires, are only given a single waypoint.  There are two more I wrote that are in staging right now. (I would show you them on beta, but it's down right now.)  In talking with Quincy and Berkeley, we were envisioning more like 10 of them, covering different aspects in a bit finer detail.  That, in and of itself, may make the material more memorable.

I think a large number of issues that I've seen people asking about fall into one of two classes.

TL;DR - Class One: Bonfires are too far from relevant waypoints to remember concepts to implement. Class Two: Concepts, such as API calls, are referenced or suggested without any explanation about how a new developer would go about implementing them.

The first class is a group of people that have moved through waypoints quickly but have misunderstood, forgotten, or skipped over key concepts they need to solve the bonfires (ex. syntax issues, regex, etc). For this group a couple things could help. For example, a reference back to key waypoints which would help ""solve"" the bonfire (the regex ones would be a great example here). Or, the bonfires, rather than being grouped together, could be dispersed closer to the relevant waypoints as reinforcement steps.

The second class is a group of people who are frustrated when a referenced concept is suggested but hasn't been taught before. Examples here would be how to make a cross-domain API call, how to use codepen or cloud9, etc. I think this area is getting better but since FCC can't explain everything this might be a necessary evil. This is also much more prevalent in ziplines than it is in bonfires. 

FCC is a work in progress and, as anything iterative, is getting better. Continuing to move things around and fine tune will help. I think moving bonfires closer to relevant waypoints as reinforcement or at least referencing the waypoints as well as introducing some new waypoints on ziplines, interfaces, methodology would get the most bang for the buck. My guess is that code pairing would've solved a lot of this but, for whatever reason, this seems to be not taken advantage of or impractical for most people I'm seeing."

Maybe add a few easier steps at first? I’m not saying don’t push them out of the nest. That’s why FCC is important. It forces you to apply theory. The other places don’t push you out on your own. That’s why I joined here. I would never have done it on my own.

It can look confusing and like they're trying to show you prototype chaining, but that isn't the case.
Read parameter descriptions carefully, as a function may behave very differently depending on the parameters you give it (or don't give it). Sometimes parameters are callback functions, like in .forEach(), and that function has its own parameters that are listed on the page. Any optional arguments (that can really change how the method works if you do/don't include them) are shown in [brackets]."

You mention the optional argument, but be sure to mention they are always in [] and how callback is not a variable, it is a callback function and the parameters are what it can take and that you won’t always need all of them.  For the longest time I thought “If  I can’t even understand the syntax example then I must really not know this stuff”.  

Also I would mention how the MDN lists things as Array.prototype.forEach() instead of arr.forEach() and just acknowledge it.  Might not be the place to go into details on it, but I was always confused about it and chucked it under something else I should know but just don’t."

Vimeo unfortunatly doesn't have that feature, but is a fantastic hosting site.

If I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying that the google dev tools unit should include more about debugging, and that more debugging videos that go beyond google dev tools would be helpful. If so, I couldn't agree more, especially about adding more debugging help. Please make a github issue, and include any specific ideas or resources that you've found helpful for debugging. I'm researching and learning as I go, and would be open to any points or strategies that are useful. :)

* It seems that Google DevTools empahasises on efficiency too. I think it is important, but not sure if there should be emphasised at this stage? I would suggest to summarise the efficiency part and make more emphasis on debugging?
* I don't know the rest of this debugging waypoint but is it possible to follow the implementation using an example to go through, bit like CodeAcademy? I think it was great to show for example how to make debugging for ziplines (great! I didn't know that...)... I think it would be then reasonable if you take as examples things that we are currently dealing with: ziplines, bonfires, waypoints and basejumps...
* Is there a way to indicate the order in vimeo so you can see your path? Just to follow the order... Although I am also happy to realise that you can see any of them independently...
* Finally, can you add here and there other strategies for debugging, apart of Google DevTools? Debugging is per se a technique that should be learnt, imo, and GoogleDevTools is just part of it..."
