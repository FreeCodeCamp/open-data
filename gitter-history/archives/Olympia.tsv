55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-10-18T04:34:40.363Z	56177d61d33f749381a8cc6a	kilroy59	56232160fc3237f04a0ca108	Thank you @TrishSnyder  and good luck. A couple of the bonfires really had me thinking.  I think the zip lines will be a little less mental intensive, but, more time consuming. I took the day off today, to hang out with the family.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-10-17T21:28:19.457Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	5622bd7303c6b52d3c5983bc	I hear that, @kilroy59. Congratulations on getting to the zip lines! I have two more bonfires to go before I get there.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-10-17T09:21:45.608Z	56177d61d33f749381a8cc6a	kilroy59	562213299fe8a6060a1c9a7c	@TrishSnyder  It pays the bills and provides me enough extra time to do things like FFC. My goal is to get into development full time.

55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-10-16T19:14:03.059Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	56214c7bfc3237f04a0c786e	@kilroy59 . Ouch. Not a shift I'd want. @jreitsch, I think I'm good for the 21st.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-10-16T15:30:50.728Z	56177d61d33f749381a8cc6a	kilroy59	5621182a5560144738d64416	I work a weird schedule so I either have Monday & Tuesday  and a three day weekend off or I have Wednesday & Thursday off, depending on the week. How's that for confusing? To top it off I work nights for two weeks and then days for two weeks.  I'm coming off nights today & will start days on Monday. 
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-10-16T15:25:15.011Z	56177d61d33f749381a8cc6a	kilroy59	562116db5560144738d643b8	21st might be good.  I won't know until a week or two out. I will try to come to as many as I can make.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-10-16T14:07:05.530Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	56210489f628367b16c88643	So @kilroy59 if you work very other Saturday (oh crap why am I tempted to write this sentence as code?) and you work this Saturday then you would be working Saturday the 14th of November. Thanksgiving is the 26th.  How about the 21st? Would that be too close to the Holiday for anyone?

55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-10-15T23:26:37.151Z	56177d61d33f749381a8cc6a	kilroy59	5620362d356b58993c494a16	I have a staggered work week, so I'm free every other Saturday.  I'm good with just about any time and would be at best available on a bi weekly basis for any time picked. I like the idea of running a hangout at these meetings because even if I'm off, I won't always have the time to be there physically.  In short I'm good with whatever is decided. I'm just happy to have ran into a group of  people interested in coding, closer than Seattle.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-10-15T17:40:25.664Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	561fe50977333bcf6d92c2db	Sup kilroy! Are all Saturdays no good for you or just this one? I'm outta town for this one too but we talked about monthly meetups.  I'm just pulling this outta my... hat... right now but maybe we can start aiming for sometime between the 10th and 17th of November?

We don't have a formal meeting planned, but one of the campers and I are meeting in Oly on Saturday. Not set time yet.

I've been working on Treehouse and haven't tried to actually progress on FCC since the big overhaul last month. Now I'm trying to fill in the new exercises that have appeared but I can't seem to make them update after I have done them. There's no ""Go To My Next Challenge"" button at all - which is the button that is supposed to be grayed out until you have successfully completed the exercise. Am I missing something? I assume I am.... Help?"

After we write out the algorithm, after we know what steps that we need to take, then we can look for specific ways to accomplish those steps. I know my first step in figuring out the Factorializing a number bonfire was to first figure out what the heck a factorial was! 
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-27T16:39:30.982Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55df3d42c5601f830c8706e4	I think that having to look at multiple outside resources is a good thing. Programming is about problem solving which involves being able to find what you need when you need it. My view on the bonfires is that they force you to look beyond what you've just learned to solve the problems. What we learned in the first part got us to understand just enough about programming so that we can do that. Was this part of the idea behind it @QuincyLarson?  
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-27T16:07:02.902Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	55df35a63d0b019620af42d2	@sushiyea yes it is $25 per month. I'm still currently on my 14 day free trial but after shopping around Treehouse is my chosen catch-up program for the moment. FCC is still my main course. This seems to be part of the deal with FCC - you have to be able to use outside resources to fill in gaps a LOT as you work through it, which is fine! It's important to develop the skill of finding and using a broad array of resources.

Just going through some dental surgery crap so it's a mildly inactive period for me just at the moment. What do I do for fun besides coding? Hmm...  Not much just now, honestly.  I kinda spend most of my free time at Treehouse and FCC. While I have been too stoned on pain meds to focus on coding I've binge watched The Office and Parks and Rec and loved them both. Also currently kinda hooked on the Android game, ""Fallout Shelter"". Erm, mostly just cuz it's there."

I started FCC a couple of weeks ago or so. I'm new to coding so the first few jQuery lessons were definitely a challenge. Anyway, I thought I would check this part of FCC out.

55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:36:16.403Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfece09fb911ea3129ed4a	Me as well.

Like you, it hasn't sunk in yet. I definitely get CSS, though I need a LOT more practical experience with it. I registered a couple of domains with goDaddy so I have some space to goof around.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:34:38.537Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfec7eeff8f1d77cc30656	I’ll see if I can find you some resources on it and post them on our FB site.

55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:33:47.174Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfec4b37816be77caf78fc	Check the site out. I think you can do a free trial. They cover a LOT of topics. I’m going to go over the jQuery for web designers today. 
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:33:37.436Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	55bfec419fb911ea3129ed28	I think you just hit the nail on the head. I don't yet grasp what DOM is about.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:32:57.171Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfec19eff8f1d77cc30649	It’s easier in that there is less code, but you really need to understand the DOM to understand jQuery.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:32:52.985Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	55bfec14eff8f1d77cc30648	Tell me more about Lynda.com?
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:32:15.071Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	55bfebef7a6037e67c5962c5	"Yeah I've wondered about that too. I took C++ classes way back and I'm pretty sure JS would be a breeze for me; but the FCC program says they are introducing it ""the easy way"" by starting with jQuery. That... confuses me."
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:32:07.029Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfebe77a6037e67c5962c2	I was on Team Treehouse, and that was an excellent site, but you really kinda felt on your own.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:31:50.921Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfebd668c869d67cf010d2	Oh, another resource for you if you are interested in paying a little. Lynda.com is a great site. About $25 a month. I’m using that now in conjunction with FCC.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:31:02.067Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfeba62c1b3bec31987a34	Oh, yeah! that one.

55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:30:48.855Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	55bfeb982c1b3bec31987a31	oh... the one with all the caffine... Jolt?
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:30:28.946Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfeb84eff8f1d77cc3063a	It’s not bad. A bit tough at times because of the soft ground, but worth it. 
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:30:11.571Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	55bfeb7337816be77caf78d2	Sounds wonderful!

55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:29:12.706Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfeb389fb911ea3129ed0a	Yeah. It’s pretty cool. Though it doesn’t have shade so I have to use it in the mornings and the evenings. I have a Rottie and a Golden that I walke with. And my husband, of course.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:28:30.033Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	55bfeb0e2c1b3bec31987a1e	So three laps make a mile? That's awesome! I wish I had a private track like that!

55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:26:15.312Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	55bfea877a6037e67c596292	Mine was a pic I had taken with a former Seahawk that I work with. Before that pic I knew I was heavy, but I DID lift weights and stuff. I thought I had a football-player's physique.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:26:10.844Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfea8237816be77caf78b5	It was a big one. His Glucose levels were through the roof. He didn’t have any symptoms, however. They caught it on an annual check up.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:25:34.458Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfea5e9fb911ea3129eced	Well, no…. I tried programming after a couple of drinks one night and, while I had fun, NOTHING worked.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:25:23.601Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	55bfea53eff8f1d77cc30622	Good for him! Sometimes all we need is the right wake-up call.
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:24:58.365Z	559551f315522ed4b3e33e75	jreitsch	55bfea3a7a6037e67c596289	So I'm finally getting it all fixed. So just about the time I finised HTML/CSS in FCC and started jQuery, I was stoned on vicodin all the time and it just ... didn't make it IN. :)
55becad90fc9f982beabebd2	FreeCodeCamp/Olympia	2015-08-03T22:24:40.093Z	55a074615e0d51bd787afa3a	TrishSnyder	55bfea2868c869d67cf010a4	Ray, my husband, used to drink a LOT of soda. He ended up with type 2 diabetes. Doing well, now though.

It was really just a typewriter that was connected via an acoustic modem to a computer. I played Oregon Trail on it. I had the printouts of my games at the time but of course they're long gone now. :)

I’m taking time off of work to re-adjust from moving to cow-town (minus the cows) so Monday really has no meaning to me.
