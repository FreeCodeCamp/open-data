We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

I have been self-employed fully online since 1998 and honestly it would be hard to want to go work the 9-5 being someone else’s mule.  With that said…I do have to fly by the seat of my pants, but I am undergoing a paradigm shift in my approach to my business right now.  I am in the process of formulating a better plan and a system for breaking out of the rut I have developed in the last few years.   Hopefully I can report that it is working like gangbusters by this time next year.

I had instructor tell me that most of the classes being taught today can be found online, you just have to have the discipline to follow through.  I hear all the time that a degree is important but the hiring managers want, and emphaisize certifications as the number one priority.

These Huntsville companies (and the government) are notorious for require the same generic BS in CS degree though. If you had a lot of experience you could probably get in though. They want to see the math. UAH told me I need 41 credit hours before I could even start a masters in Software Engineering. Tough. Bachelors is probably a few more hours. Likely 2 years if I took full loads.

It actually made sense.  Crazy huh?  You need to check that out because he is such a good teacher.  I was actually trying to figure out if I wanted to go back to college for a Computer Science  degree.  Even though the video made since, after more thought, I have decided to stick to learning to code on my own.   I don't have the time, money or energy to devote a couple years getting another bachelors degree.  I considered a professional coders camp called lampcamp in Atlanta that is free but even then... it is hard to break away from family for 12 weeks.

Once you really get a grasp on one or two languages it's much easier to learn another. You just need to know the quirks and standards (whitespace in Python, camelCase in JavaScript, etc.), syntax, and block structure. Then, you can go as deep as you want.

I get in some courses when I can but it is tough to find time.  With the course, I am done with html/css and jquery now.  @Trime2x1  Ages range from 6 weeks to 14 years old!  I don't have a lot of issues with her yet... just some back talking at times. :-(   My 10 year old is starting too a bit but they  dont get far when they show an attitude.  @bryonmiller  I just have gotten on Javascript too.

I'm on the JavaScript portion now. I'd love to pair program with you guys when we get to that section.

I have a ten year old going on 16. I'll need some advice for the  up coming tumultuous teenage passage of rite, other than drinking heavily, lol!

I'm enjoying the journey thus far.  I've just started the jQuery segment and it's been good so far. I had a few steps that made me scratch my head but eventually got it right.
5593927715522ed4b3e3250f	FreeCodeCamp/BirminghamAlabama	2015-09-01T03:16:38.982Z	55b1b2970fc9f982beaac9fa	bryonmiller	55e518969753899b5da2ce01	@websiteinteractive Wow, sounds like it. We don't have kids yet, but even just being married and working full time poses enough of a challenge. It sounds like you are further along in this field, but if I can ever help you out just let me know.

I have a Facebook page on Alabama with 211K fans... I can't seem to find time to post to it these days.

Let me know if you follow through with that startup! I've considered the same thing, but I've got a lot to learn before I do that. Roll Tide!

Good to hear from some locals coding here in FreeCodeCamp.com  @bryonmiller I am from Crossville not too far from Scootsboro!  Grew up in Geraldine / Lakeview area so I know the back way to Section to get to Scottsboro.  Used to go to tradeday there a lot.  I am seeing what I can do to improve my coding abilities.  I have done web design since 1998, for others since 2001.  I have been a self employeed all internet based business for years.  I started out as a high school Science teacher but fell in love withe computer.. and have been doing it ever since.  LOL  Anyway, I am hoping to be able to start developing mobile apps, knowing more about Javascript/jQuery,and later I want to get into full stack development with Ruby on Rails.  I am considering getting out of being self employed for something more secure with health insurance, but I am not sure what they will think since I have worked on my own for so long.  I would prefer to launch my own startup however, as I am very entreprenuerial by spirit.  Good to meet you too @Trime2x1 and everyone else in here!   Roll Tide!  :-)

I just started at Athens State University and working on the information assurance (cyber security) degree now.

I am to your East in Scottsboro. Did you get some sort of IT degree from Calhoun? Also, what type of work do you do now?
5593927715522ed4b3e3250f	FreeCodeCamp/BirminghamAlabama	2015-08-28T13:47:14.164Z	55d5eacb0fc9f982beae0dc2	Trime2x1	55e066620a73ad6d32de1368	"In 2013 I started my IT journey at Calhoun Community College. I was going to be a ""hardware-guy"", nothing more, nothing less...that didn't last long, lol! As SDN started to become popular and  add scripting languages as a must to one's career, I find myself here at FCC. I love this site, especially being a Noob, such as myself."

I had been in logistics in one form another for about 20 years, and I just got burnt out.  And I had become soooo complacent, that it took an employer to fire my old butt to get me started.

A strong portfolio shows skill and experience in another way. Some companies actually prefer this over a degree. 
5593927715522ed4b3e3250f	FreeCodeCamp/BirminghamAlabama	2015-08-06T15:59:37.326Z	55b1b2970fc9f982beaac9fa	bryonmiller	55c38469c86aa0e276a50cda	"From my experience, the answer depends a lot of the company and how ""formal training"" is defined. Web development seems to be the easiest to get into without a degree. The other fields are so math heavy that they want to know you have those skills. I have known people to start out with web development and then break into other areas from there. It usually comes down to one word: portfolio."

I was looking up junior web developer positions last night, and most of them require a bachelor's degree in computer science!  I don't have that.  Is it hard to find a job in IT without ""formal"" training?"

5593927715522ed4b3e3250f	FreeCodeCamp/BirminghamAlabama	2015-08-05T13:34:10.302Z	55b1b2970fc9f982beaac9fa	bryonmiller	55c210d27a6037e67c59a31e	Sounds awesome. I bet the transition from an English major to computer science is tough. I know it is coming from psychology. I have given serious consideration to getting my A+ certification as well. It comes in handy it you want to work for a government agency.

In addition to working my way through FCC (it is rocking awesome...especially the beta version which has more awesome challenges) I am also studying for the CompTIA A+ Certification exams. I know that this is not programming, but it is still fun for me to learn the ins and outs of a computer (literally)

I have a BS in English and I am currently working as an academic tutor and a CNA.  I've always loved dabbling in computer science, and I am excited to jump back into the world of coding! My brother is a computer engineer.

BS in Psychology, currently working as in Job Placement on a college campus, and trying to break into web development. I've always enjoyed programming, but never learned enough to do much. I neglected it through college, so now I'm trying to leap back into it.

I'm really excited to meet some more people who are also interested in learning about coding! I just started FCC a few weeks back, but I have not been very consistent like I should be.  So, I'm starting over with the challenges for a review!

Here is a good article on when it is best to use it.  https://css-tricks.com/when-using-important-is-the-right-choice/
5593927715522ed4b3e3250f	FreeCodeCamp/BirminghamAlabama	2015-07-11T20:04:05.136Z	559ac21315522ed4b3e37ddc	websiteinteractive	55a176b52840f1ff0c48ab27	@tlovett88  I am not even that far in the course yet, but I am a web designer already. I am very skilled in css.  You can obviously do something like an inline style (which is not really kosher) or you can override the class with !important.  Since I have not crossed that point yet... I am still just in first few challenges... I don't really know the question.  If you could send a screenshot of the question to me so I know what you are referring to, I know I can help you.
