I want code to allow me to turn many of my ideas into reality.  For example, I have a neighbour who's daughter has an undiagnosed vision impairment.  This is now the third one at our local school.  If we had a website where people could anonymously enter their health profiles along with their general location and exercise and eating habits then we could create health profiles that can highlight issues in water supply or nutrition education or access to parks or poor air quality.  Possibilities with code are endless.

I also tried codeacademy, its pretty good stuff. i think ffc is a lot more helpful because there are people to talk to and meetup with. i did stuff on and off so i didnt get to the ziplines until i came back to ffc and spent more time on it.

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying ‚Äúhello‚Äù and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We‚Äôve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you‚Äôd like.

Then, after disabling, you will have a run button showing on top of your screen, and you can just click run each time you want to refresh. It's better that way.

Then you can compare it with its reverse via reverseString() to see if it's a palindrome

I did game development at uni, leaning on the programming side. I'm doing the FCC to expand my skill-set I guess.
