We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.

I must have dropped off before you responded, and have only just made it back here thanks to the invitation to 'PairProgram'. Professionally, I stopped coding about 10 years ago, although have kept up some skills up by coding plenty of dos batch scripts & vba macros. Suppose it just goes to show you can take a bloke out of programming, but you can't take the programming out of a bloke ;)
5593973315522ed4b3e32615	FreeCodeCamp/Melbourne	2015-08-04T12:45:35.881Z	55982e2715522ed4b3e35edb	roamingtim	55c0b3ef37816be77caf8c9d	Yeah, that is for someone straight out of uni I think. I should be able to get $75,000 which is the average full time salary I believe. So better be more than $50k-$60k!
5593973315522ed4b3e32615	FreeCodeCamp/Melbourne	2015-08-04T12:40:07.685Z	55b9b7990fc9f982beab7d3c	Gornstats	55c0b2a7eff8f1d77cc31aa2	@roamingtim there seems to be a big range in salaries, but junior front-end jobs pay around 50k-60k from what I've seen

Anyone have any idea how much we will earn as a beginner (I have Internet Marketing, SEO, and Web Dev experience)

But I do understand the 'up and running' quickly argument. It's a fine line. I guess I'd be more comfortable starting people on Bootstrap if it was accompanied with deeper explanation of what is going on under the hood at the same time."
5593973315522ed4b3e32615	FreeCodeCamp/Melbourne	2015-07-27T11:27:34.625Z	55b32d310fc9f982beaaecd9	GilFewster	55b615a6cfe8c23a6dfab8fb	@watsondr Bootstrap is really heavy, and the default package includes vast swathes of stuff you probably won't use on any single site. But you need some solid CSS fundamentals to work with it best.
5593973315522ed4b3e32615	FreeCodeCamp/Melbourne	2015-07-27T09:49:53.422Z	55a3b7175e0d51bd787b39b9	watsondr	55b5fec1cfe8c23a6dfab6d3	"@GilFewster which specific cons? I'm not too familiar but have dabbled in to it a little myself. Being entrenched in to a particular page structure that may not suit the design of a page, causing spaghetti code later on after a few edits is something I'm cautious of when I use it. 

I found it heavily time consuming to edit the underlying CSS as a straight plugin to a site too because of the default attributes, but it makes it so much quicker to get 'something' up and running."

Just orienting myself with the waypoints, but so far pretty impressed with the structure of the lessons. Seems like a nice way in for beginners, although I'm not sure about the dive into using Bootstrap classes without any real talk about pros/cons. But I guess the point is practical exercise, not theory.

I'm just getting through the bonfires when I can at the moment.  I'd love to be finished by the end of the year too, but with other commitments its unlikely.  Anyone else further ahead?

But tired now so I want to come home and get a 6-12 month job in a cubicle and learn on the job, make connections etc

Sounds glamorous but I was saving a heap of money and living a basic life. So it was cheaper to travel than to live in Melbourne because I was earning money on the road.
