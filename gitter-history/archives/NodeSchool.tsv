in expressworks , on ""Stylish CSS"" users will have to use ""sudo expressworks verify program.js""
Also before installing expressworks, users will have to delete the whole environment previously set up and set it up in a completly new environment..

we will be needing to fork the expressworks on challenge ""Whats In Query"" it is made for Express 3.4.3 version .. the code will be correct, but the answers are in different format ..

In ""how-to-npm"" i have problems in two excercises ""dist-tag"" & ""dist-tag removal""

All others are working fine in learnyounode, expressworks and how-to-npm @ https://codeanywhere.com/ , tested all 

@reddock sure! (:"

5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T18:21:48.637Z	54e24edb15522ed4b3dc154f	reddock	55217d3c05184cd235fbf1c9	Yeah I think that is the right way to go. Messing with setting up your own environment can waste so much time and be frustrating. 
5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T17:20:21.540Z	546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c	QuincyLarson	55216ed5af9675d135ab5a9d	Also, Free Code Camp’s goal is to keep everything in the browser (our modo is free, self-paced, browser-based).

5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T17:19:04.889Z	546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c	QuincyLarson	55216e881f582983259f4bdc	@morenoh149 yes, we will probably create forks of these three challenges. I noticed that there were some minor typos/ambiguities in the instructions. We’ll submit pull requests to the original repo as we make changes.
5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T17:17:57.615Z	546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c	QuincyLarson	55216e4505184cd235fbf0ff	@reddock I agree with McQuinTrix - if codeanywhere is working for most of these (with minor workarounds), I think we should go with that instead of c9.io
5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T11:19:35.984Z	54e24edb15522ed4b3dc154f	reddock	55211a474ceaec8225f94133	@morenoh149 I have nothing against c9. I was just trying to say that I wasn't going out of my way to look for cloud IDEs, I just want to help here. The biggest advantage for cloud IDEs for me is that I can use my desktop or laptop to work on things no matter where I'm at. I travel often so that is super useful.

5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T01:43:55.328Z	54e24edb15522ed4b3dc154f	reddock	5520935b4ceaec8225f93d8c	Its the timeout value in the expressworks test
5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T01:43:45.411Z	54e24edb15522ed4b3dc154f	reddock	552093516e3562b64f53522e	Ok I figured it out
5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T01:32:29.801Z	54e24edb15522ed4b3dc154f	reddock	552090ad05184cd235fbe941	The browser won't bring up a port I pass it but I can 'curl -X GET http://localhost:5566' and receive the correct response. 
5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T01:30:11.301Z	54e24edb15522ed4b3dc154f	reddock	552090234ceaec8225f93d6e	I haven't started writing one yet. Trying to figure out the port stuff with c9. It only seems to like the port it gives you. expressworks wants to pass ports as an argument to verify you completed the exercise 
5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T01:25:16.699Z	53dd5a53107e137846ba8f16	morenoh149	55208efc05184cd235fbe924	where are the docs in progress?

5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T01:04:32.326Z	54e24edb15522ed4b3dc154f	reddock	55208a20af9675d135ab5272	Yeah but just copying and pasting it isn't going to help them much either
5520117215522ed4b3de5a2f	FreeCodeCamp/NodeSchool	2015-04-05T01:04:09.284Z	54a78b4edb8155e6700e5350	McQuinTrix	55208a09af9675d135ab5271	saying to first timers to set their port to process.env.PORT can be little bit painful for them ..
