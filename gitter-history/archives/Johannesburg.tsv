We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

However i'm not able to see it.?? (Very Confused.). I guess i will just resend a message. Have been trying to get into the coding game for a while now but never got anywhere due to my hours at work. Have been able to start doing it a bit more lately so, my answers is kind of. have prior experience. The first zipline was more based on functionality than design, i will spend some time on it later to make it look nicer.

Do you have any prior coding experience or is this your first venture into it?

I signed up here mostly as a way to distract me from my frustration with that. I've been blogging for a couple of years now and thought it'd be interesting to find out how the technical aspects of websites work, but I'm enjoying it much more than I thought I would.
