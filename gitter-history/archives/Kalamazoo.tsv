We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

I am a programming mentor and our new season is starting.  Last year we went to State Championships and to World Champs in St. Louis. This year we are in desperate need of CAD mentors and another programming mentor.  We have to limit the number of students we can take because we don't have enough mentors to help. I would hate to see any kid turned away. We meet in Battle Creek (Springfield) on Thursday nights. We dont need experts, just looking for someone committed to helping regularly and willing to learn.  We are a non-profit organization, so mileage and any donations are tax deductible. If you are interested, or know of anyone else that may be interested, give me a shout. Thanks!

And sometimes if I've done something particularly dumb on one of my sites, I can open developers tools, make changes right there and see what happens. I've been building sites since the 90s.  I'm old enough to remember hamster dance and mouse trails. LOL

I admit that I had to peek at it for a couple of elements! How long have you been developing? 
5593964015522ed4b3e325d9	FreeCodeCamp/Kalamazoo	2015-09-25T15:02:36.692Z	55f960df0fc9f982beb0dc27	LibertysYarn	5605620c5064bb2c74d94ef3	Over the years I've learned to love 'view source' (ctrl-u) and (if you're in Chrome) the developers tools. I've learned to much just checking out how someone else did it. And Stack Overflow is a sanity saver. =D
5593964015522ed4b3e325d9	FreeCodeCamp/Kalamazoo	2015-09-22T02:27:37.796Z	55ae83e30fc9f982beaa74c2	rxsangria	5600bc99c588a0de6edfa6b6	@jhois went back to the portfolio zipline, there's a link in the instructions to fork a sample so you don't have to start from scratch. I didn't see that before (was it there?)  Anyways, it's a little easier modifying an already existing framework, although it still is a lot of work!  The Bootstrap link that @LibertysYarn posted helps too.

On twitter I found a free admission code via a social entrepreneur firm helping nonprofits, PUBLICGOOD, and that's the code (PUBLICGOOD) you input when you register; about 12 hours ago, I got in for free, so may still be working

Anyway, got off-track; so cool to see several of YOU making such quick progress! Inspirational. I find it difficult to not have much local in-person contact; anyone go to any local meet-ups?GR? A2/Detroit?

5593964015522ed4b3e325d9	FreeCodeCamp/Kalamazoo	2015-09-14T01:33:54.603Z	5588179815522ed4b3e2634a	jhois	55f624024624296d78af12c7	Yeah I still haven't done that if you have any tips let me know.  I don't feel prepared to do it at all.
5593964015522ed4b3e325d9	FreeCodeCamp/Kalamazoo	2015-09-12T00:00:33.437Z	55ae83e30fc9f982beaa74c2	rxsangria	55f36b216fe7b2a123eb0e9d	I started the portfolio zipline. Is it just me, or is it super complicated? It says 'don't look at the original code', but why?  Seems like they want us to re-invent the wheel! 
5593964015522ed4b3e325d9	FreeCodeCamp/Kalamazoo	2015-09-09T00:05:05.285Z	5588179815522ed4b3e2634a	jhois	55ef77b196450ece4d880951	done with most of the bonfire and trying to do the front end ziplines

5593964015522ed4b3e325d9	FreeCodeCamp/Kalamazoo	2015-08-05T19:42:07.694Z	55ae83e30fc9f982beaa74c2	rxsangria	55c2670feff8f1d77cc35774	On javascript,  it's also a codacademy review for me. I will let you know when I'm done reviewing and on to Bonfires.  Should be in the next couple of days. :smile:  :fire: 
5593964015522ed4b3e325d9	FreeCodeCamp/Kalamazoo	2015-08-03T00:14:00.269Z	55ae83e30fc9f982beaa74c2	rxsangria	55beb2487978296537a313e7	Ok now on jquery, but I already did the codeacademy tutorial a year ago. Should be a piece of cake! 
5593964015522ed4b3e325d9	FreeCodeCamp/Kalamazoo	2015-08-02T22:41:50.098Z	55ae83e30fc9f982beaa74c2	rxsangria	55be9cae7978296537a31214	Not yet, still doing the beginner stuff. Waypoints is it called?  Anyways its going pretty quickly so far, the html/css is just refresher for me
5593964015522ed4b3e325d9	FreeCodeCamp/Kalamazoo	2015-08-02T19:39:45.660Z	5588179815522ed4b3e2634a	jhois	55be7201dcea60b379ff0277	Awesome are you on the bonfires?
