Nothing to do (that's a lie, I have to deliver a site to a friend by Wednesday), and there's a Starbucks near my home at Fair Oaks and Orange Grove (they're everywhere though, obviously, and I imagine there are better ones). Maybe even a place like Teaspots would be better (boba, etc). What exactly are you interested in conversing about/working on? I haven't really focused on working through the stuff here at FCC because of other projects/pursuits. I noticed some Ruby in your Github, definitely not something I'm familiar with.. Mostly interested in Javascript right now

Are you guys available Monday's or Tuesday's anytimev

I've been to one event since moving to the area and it was unrelated to FCC (it was MongoDB evenings LA). I'm definitely down to help facilitate or at least join events. My only issue is that I also have a (code-unrelated) job that eats up a lot of nights and weekends.

Since there’s not a whole lot of traffic here yet, please also see the Los Angeles room. But check back here regularly if you want to meet up in the San Gabriel Valley, this should be the place to find like minded peers!
