But I still think they should have left all the 50 rooms used in the last month, instead of just 13... they could have cleared the rest, too, if they weren't used anymore. But I think that's just their trial to make people use their forum (so they get content there)...

There's a few fundamental building blocks around interactive media in general, not just games, but I can't give a through overview at this point.

There's a bunch of stuff considering Unity, I think - such as the scene graph and entity-based design regarding the engine itself. I'm not very familiar with Unity however.

Not the game design, such as the theory of gameplay and interaction and all that good stuff - just how to implement stuff.

Game programming in general uses some concepts usually not found elsewhere in mainstream/beginner-level development. Of course as there's a lot of APIs and moving parts in the Unity engine/platform, that means lots of complexity to deal with. Still probably better than having to code all these things yourself.

C# is definitely the best-supported language in Unity, with most people developing games on it using exactly that, so lots of resources & code samples are in just C#. I'm not sure I want to invest in learning C#, but I guess it might pay off on the long run if I stick to it.

I used LOVE framework for Lua a while ago, and Lua in general lacks resources, let alone a bare-bones framework that uses it as its scripting language. And oh, you have problems with the performance, @Rogue00?

I've heard it a lot that the key at first is to prototype game ideas really rapidly, so you get to know which ideas work design/gameplay-wise and which ones don't. Can't rely on brining a great idea to life as it should be with first, second, or third attempt - the key is iteration, they say. So you need to find a platform you can safely, reliably use for rapid prototyping (hack together a basic mechanic in a day or so, something like that) and iterate with that. Unity is a common choice for that, so is GameMaker, as these generally allow to build stuff quickly, however possible. At the same time, no denying there's a learning curve in both. Unity at least has lots of resources and tutorials all over the web, unlike some much more obscure barebones frameworks that don't really make it to being fully-fledged engines.
