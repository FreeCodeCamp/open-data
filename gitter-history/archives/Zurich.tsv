I know about those groups, but I thought I also join this group, since I live in Zurich. And I was also interested how many people in Zurich are FreeCodeCamp members. Maybe we can make this group more active and even meet sometime ... who knows :)

We meet every 2 weeks. Feel free to join, if you think it could be something for you: http://www.meetup.com/Zurich-Interactive-Data-Visualisation-Atelier/

And sure just drop your questions :-) maybe you would get more help in the HelpJavascript or HelpFrontendroom though since this room seems to be quite empty

I like the page and idea of learning and coding for non-profit projects. The idea of having a chat room for this is also very cool. I probably drop a question here from time to time while improving my web development skils :)
