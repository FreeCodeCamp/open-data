When and where should we host coffee and code? Here are options pick the best that works for you.  


Time: 
- morning 
- lunch 
- afternoon / evening

Location: 
- Smokey row (central des Moines) 
- Starbucks (west or east des moines) 
- Skype/hangouts 

This last week was crazy but my schedule will ease up in the next week(s). I'm going to need coffee to help with this self induced sleep deprivation. Who's up for caffeine induced developing????

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

Well there is the library and also im sure there are some decent community centers that are open to the public around the area. A coffee shop might not be bad if its a low trafficked area or one with a lot of room. Just throwing out some suggestions.

I can't promise regular attendance at meet ups but would definitely be interested.  I'll probably be way behind and might have some strange questions.  I have been doing some coding with my students and find many of them have gone way beyond my knowledge and/or skills and I am missing the language/understanding to even point them in the right direction in terms of what they could be trying and/or how to help them if they get stuck. So...my interest is twofold...develop my own knowledge and skills as a resource to help my students and to discover whether this could be a viable alternate career path for me!

559393d715522ed4b3e32567	FreeCodeCamp/DesMoines	2015-07-23T00:27:16.215Z	55a2cf875e0d51bd787b2872	JosiahPR	55b034e4f2cdad46058b0356	@matthewsvm I dont think that would be a bad idea down the road.  Many of us here are fairly new if not completely new to the ideas and basics. So throwing too much in the mix might end up being counterproductive if one doesn't have a thorough understanding of the main 3 featured in freecodecamp. Definitely a great idea on looking at prospective coding or stack dev jobs in DSM and seeing what other skills we can tack on and help eachother learn!

You’re right, we don’t all need to go to all of them.  In fact, this group will probably get too big for that anyway.  If you have a date/time that works for you, post it, and we can respond with a yay or nay.

So, if someone would like to reserve a room, just invite us all, and who can make it should go.  I think the main thing we should be concentrating on is practicing together and helping each other out.  We don't all have to be at the same place in FCC.  In fact, I think teaching what you've already done will help get it to sink in.

Maybe you'll want to start a group for that city if one doesn't already exist.  :smile:
