Backend and data vis is something I haven't started yet, but I'd imagine it entails php and some sort of database language.
55959b4515522ed4b3e34373	FreeCodeCamp/Cleveland	2016-02-15T18:47:33.420Z	569eb9a9e610378809bd2d2b	scrufflynx	56c21d45186fc96e04bac868	Oh yeah we try to help each other out in here as much as possible

There are also a lot of other online training programs much cheaper than the 10k or 12k you will pay to a local bootcamp. I've been thinking about it myself. I went to a meetup a few weeks ago. If you want to join a group: http://www.meetup.com/Code-Start/

The main issue with Campsite chat room was that new campers were coming in and being disappointed that the volume of messages was quite low. That's why we chose to de-list each Campsite's Gitter chat room.

I too refuse to use Facebook due to the reasons you mentioned and was glad to have this space to communicate with others in the area. I'm extremely disappointed in Free Code Camp's decision to make this change.

Several other people shared this sentiment. There's a constant struggle between security and convenience. in 2015, most people are extremely busy, and we want to go the lowest-friction route. Facebook is a platform built from literally millions of engineer-hours. It is unmatched. I recommend creating a ""burner"" Facebook account so you can still make use of these campsites. "

I would appreciate at least some way to do announcements about events that doesn't involve me confirming the information Facebook has collected on me without my consent.  I know its a lot easier to use services like Facebook rather than invest the time and resources in reinventing that particular wheel, but I hope some compromise can be found.   Meanwhile, if anyone organizing events in Cleveland or better yet Akron could drop me a note at the address on my github profile, it would be greatly appreciated.

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

I don't know what everyone else's schedule looks like, but since I can't do evening/after work events, I'm casting  a vote for weekends.  I'm in an eastern 'burb and could help scope out meeting places on this side if we rotate spots or if this area works for the majority. Anyone else have thoughts on the logistics?
