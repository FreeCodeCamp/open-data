55c3af5b0fc9f982beac7e17	FreeCodeCamp/Halifax	2016-05-16T22:05:03.177Z	573931d9c43b8c6019731b6d	72undead	573a440feea93e5742d270f4	I'll deffinatly check it out!

55c3af5b0fc9f982beac7e17	FreeCodeCamp/Halifax	2016-05-16T22:01:34.701Z	573931d9c43b8c6019731b6d	72undead	573a433eae26c1967f9f071c	Yeah I looked at them a few times. I guess I just like the challange of being able to make things myself?
55c3af5b0fc9f982beac7e17	FreeCodeCamp/Halifax	2016-05-16T22:00:45.131Z	55f5b57c0fc9f982beb08e79	rickstewart	573a430dc61823687d3c6e87	If you are just looking to build a personal website and you are not interested in learning to code there are a bunch of WYSIWYG building sites online.  I'd use one of those, it can be a lot of fun.
55c3af5b0fc9f982beac7e17	FreeCodeCamp/Halifax	2016-05-16T21:59:41.926Z	573931d9c43b8c6019731b6d	72undead	573a42cdc61823687d3c6e77	Positive reenforcement eh?

55c3af5b0fc9f982beac7e17	FreeCodeCamp/Halifax	2016-05-16T21:58:54.782Z	55f5b57c0fc9f982beb08e79	rickstewart	573a429ee2996a5a42c8eb94	My advice is to work on the webpage and tackle the server side once you are happy with how your site looks and works.
55c3af5b0fc9f982beac7e17	FreeCodeCamp/Halifax	2016-05-16T21:58:38.231Z	573931d9c43b8c6019731b6d	72undead	573a428eae26c1967f9f06f8	A friend of mine has already said he'd help me with the Server side of things XD I just need help with the coding side of things for the website 
55c3af5b0fc9f982beac7e17	FreeCodeCamp/Halifax	2016-05-16T21:57:51.423Z	55f5b57c0fc9f982beb08e79	rickstewart	573a425f0cb634927f7f6d95	That's a good project.  Different people will be able to help with different parts of it.  Most people here can do some front end work,  and the server side stuff is maybe a little more complicated.
55c3af5b0fc9f982beac7e17	FreeCodeCamp/Halifax	2016-05-16T21:56:38.705Z	573931d9c43b8c6019731b6d	72undead	573a4216c61823687d3c6e3c	I am a global manager for a gaming community and I was put in charge of the website building and prep

Then I only have two projects remaining, Tic-tac-toe and Simon.

Also check out our local Facebook group at https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.halifax/

I'm a bit too far out of town to make it personally, but I think its fantastic for the ones that can. Anyone that can make it out I encourage you to do so, these kind of things get better and better as momentum builds, and the more that attend the stronger the momentum.
