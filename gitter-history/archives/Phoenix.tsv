I honestly don’t know why anyone would want to learn .net. Ruby is great pays well but not that many Ruby shops in AZ last time I checked. (been awhile)

It took about ~25 seconds for all of the images and the article previews to load in, if you limited the number to load to be just beyond the screen size and load the next group on scroll it would greatly reduce the loading time.

We can do our own little meet up and just schedule hangouts. Maybe once we start it we can get other people on board and set up a meet up in person. I would love to attending the Coffe and Code meet up in them morning, but I really dont have time to be quite honest.

I have used Treehouse mainly and books and coursera through a full stack developer course I am taking with them. The course covers alot in a couple of weeks in my mind. HTML CSS Javascript now we are in angular.js and next week moving onto mongoDB. So I know the basics of javascripts, I guess my challenge is how to implement those skills !

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.

I write down words to google later, or make friends with those people that know more than me. I'm sure you'd be welcomed at NodeAZ. Most meet-ups are really welcoming.

(nodeAZ is in the eastValley) but since nodeAZ is meeting on my birthday this month it’s unlikely I’ll be there (Felicia Day is doing a book signing) so I’ll go this time for sure.

I have some experience with First Lego League which tries to introduce kids to technology, so I’d definitely love to set up a local code camp.

Just a matter of finding what you like I guess.

If anyone else is in the west valley please let me know and maybe we could get together and do some paired programming and really bounce ideas off of each other.  Cheers.

Here is the Gotomeeting link:

https://gotomeet.me/FCCAZ

I'll be hosting the meeting in about 10 minutes, so if you can't connect before 5:00pm, try again at 5:00pm. if it seems to work before I host it then, well, thats good! I hope.

If there are issues getting on and it's after 5:00pm, let me know by commenting on this post, and we'll try to sort them out together.

Hopefully GotoMeeting works, and if it doesn't then we can always try and use Rabb.it as a back up (depending on the number of people who attend of course)."

Whether your new (like me who hasn't gone through much) or more experienced, it could be a great idea to get together and pick each other's brains about JavaScript - which would help solidify our knowledge of the craft! If meeting up physically can't work out due to whatever reasoning, we could also do video conferencing, like google hang outs. Let me know what you think! I'll put a notice out on FB as well, just in case there is anyone on FB who isn't part of this chat.

I am new to all of this and having people nearby might be helpful. I went to ASU, but graduated 11 years ago. I liked the area, but feel old now to cruise Mill Ave.
559398c915522ed4b3e32675	FreeCodeCamp/Phoenix	2015-07-06T02:03:58.134Z	558ee7a915522ed4b3e2ede4	angregor	5599e20efcbe8872682f0c46	@boomer1204 Haha yes thats what I’ve heard. I’m from the East Valley and until recently haven’t had a car so travelling to Tempe hasn’t really been an option. Excited for the fall semester though
559398c915522ed4b3e32675	FreeCodeCamp/Phoenix	2015-07-05T04:39:25.892Z	55947d9115522ed4b3e333ef	boomer1204	5598b4fdfcbe8872682efed5	"Yes the campus area is the younger crowd.  I'm 31 and still have a bunch of fun but it's ""known for"" the younger crowd and Old Towne Scottsdale is the ""more mature crowd"" if you get what I'm saying.  I don't really see it but i'm also not very mature :)"
