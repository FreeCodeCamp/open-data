It's called FreeCodeCamp/CodeReview (https://gitter.im/freecodecamp/CodeReview). Let's get it active.

So maybe they're working on something related to user accounts. If you're logged in maybe that's the reason you can't access them. In any case, it must mean they're doing something on the site right now that's preventing you from accessing whatever waypoints you're trying to access.

I'm guessing only owners of a repo and other specially assigned users can apply them.

my code is:
```
var myArray = ['John', 23, ['dog', 3]];
var removed = myArray.shift();
//console.log(typeof(removed));

//This should be ['John'] and myArray should now be ['John', 23]


(function(y, z){return('myArray = ' + JSON.stringify(y) + ' & removed = ' + JSON.stringify(z) /* + ' ' + typeof(z) */);})(myArray, removed);
```
The first validation is correct, but the second is not, if I check the validation there is a section which checks if 
`assert((function(d){if(d === 'John' && typeof(removed) === 'function'){return(true);}else{return(false);}})(removed), 'Removed should contain ""John""'); `
Shouldn't this check if removed is a 'string'? I don't know how and if I should make removed a function."

Like this your progress will be up to date and we can help the FCC team to spot any bugs and improve the website.
