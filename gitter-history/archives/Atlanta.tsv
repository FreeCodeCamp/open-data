We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

Cool!  Glad there is some interest!  Here is my github Repo: https://github.com/grahamlutz/MyVirtualPack

If you guys want to take a look - there is TODO.md file with some of the functionality I'd like to implement.  If you want to add to it, send a pull request. 

Should we try to schedule a time to get together and make a plan?

I'm generally available in the evenings."

Then you could make money off the sales that result.  Use Amazon links first... low hanging fruit.  I used to own an online camping gear company (I dropshipped camping gear) back in 2001 or so.  I did pretty well but it is a long story why I had to stop.  Funny thing is that the brand I created has now been reused to create a line of kayaks that are currently selling at Target.  ""Outdoor Tuff"" was the name of my website.  Anyway, I think you have a great idea.  "

Just curious.  Not exactly the way I'd recommend, but since you want this, I'll say that the main way to make it do this is set the height of #bottomspacer to 100px or whatever you want.

Lampcamp.guru may be a good place for you to develop your skills in LAMP stack if that's something you're interested in. It's free full-time immersive boot camp
559391d915522ed4b3e324e9	FreeCodeCamp/Atlanta	2015-09-03T17:13:23.748Z	55e7ca310fc9f982beaf7e10	jon-starnes	55e87fb3faa620f25267ebb4	Hello, world! I found FreeCodeCamp on Quora, and I am beyond glad I did. My previous year's background was spent in graduate school for Anthropology (MA 2013) and in Public Health. Anthropology in academic work is completely oversaturated with applicants  and  public health is becoming increasingly harder to break into as well. But I'm not just inspired by improving my career options. I am here because I like to create and I enjoy figuring things out and using a logic and analysis approach. I am also here for the freedom that comes with learning to cread from code. I first started learning shortly after undergrad work in the early 2000s and even did some front end creation and helped with code editing with an Indie Game group I co-started. I also have 2 years of recent experience managing websites and social media, but I want to learn to develop from back to front end and show total competence in core app languages. I never advanced past the medieval LAMP days, which is why I am here. My goal now is to really learn developer skills by doing things for others. I also still hold out hope that I can combine skills enhanced here with something academic (neural net AI stuff), education or healthcare related. I would also like to develop quality apps and tools.

I read the first article the coder's dilemma which was interesting since you tied in how we learn. The widgets button after pressing forces you to scroll back down to the article.  Maybe you could add a return button to the top of the page. Sorta feels like it breaks up the flow of the page. Overall great start!!

I couldn't understand its purpose. Had to find a book that gave better explanations. It will take some practice on my part.

Do you summarize the things you work on and learn for that day? Do you find the blog helps you cement what you are learning or is more a tool for documentation?

Endeca, hyperion, bi publisher, business intelligence enterprise edition, and big data discovery. I'm on the technical side of things, so I do everything from installing/configuring the software, to designing and implementing  data warehouses. We also do all of the ETL development.

I can't really travel for a while as my wife is expecting w/in a week or 2 and one of my daughters will possibly need brain surgery in August.  I would be interested in working with you but keep in mind, I am a website designer with some skills in html5, css, & php, but I am learning some of this stuff brand new.. if we can code long distance on Teamviewer for now that would be very cool for now.   How far along are you on this course?
