We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

I'm glad that there are FCC specific challenges instead redirecting to another site like codecademy. I think it lacks a bit of explanation though, especially for some of the methods being used. Should have a link to MDN for us to read more about a method we used such as the array methods like ""reduce"" or ""map"""

I'm expecting once word gets out more lots more will request assistance.  Wonder what they plan for marketing etc?

The idea of helping out NFPs is fantastic! Do you know if there are any Australian NFPs related to FCC?
55ab71e337f2ad22587e6239	FreeCodeCamp/Brisbane	2015-08-16T22:10:32.344Z	55b59ea40fc9f982beab136b	richyvk	55d10a58204de35b423059ce	@mmvalente Hey. Sounds like you’re pretty skilled up already then :) I’m very much a hobbyist. Do some html/css/JS as part of my job on occasion, that’s what really got me started. Have done a fair few online courses and stuff, know a bit of Python. I always seem to get distracted though and so I’m hoping I can see FCC through, and see what happens. I like the idea of helping out NFPs so that was a draw card for me. I’m up to the first set of bonfires, so a fair way to go. We should def organise a meetup. I’ll post something on the FB page.
55ab71e337f2ad22587e6239	FreeCodeCamp/Brisbane	2015-08-16T13:38:06.137Z	55cf31170fc9f982bead79e2	mmvalente	55d0923e204de35b42305036	@richyvk  Thanks! Not many people from Brisbane indeed. I will definitely join the group on Facebook too. I have experience working on enterprise web applications using Java, but it seems full stack JavaScript is becoming more and more popular and that's what brings me to FCC. What about you? What's your coding experience? How are you progressing in FCC? I like the meetup idea. Count me in. Let's organise  something.

Do you have much coding experience? I was thinking of suggesting here or on the facebook group that we should do some sort of meetup for Brisbane FCCers some time?
