We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

I love my new family! I need to start in my career because of my family. Minimum wage jobs just aren't going to cut it now. I finished CS50 about a month ago. My final project is a bit simple so I'm trying to add more features. So Launch Code has more to promote me with. I had a job interview about a week ago set up by LC, but they seemed to expect more work experience than what I had. Which goes against what Launch Code is all about. So that's what drew me to FCC. I'll be able to have actual projects for organizations that I can put on my resume.

I haven't been involved lately with LC and was never really ready to go all in on it since I have a full time job at the moment.

I thought I heard that some where. Well this is long and drawn out but welcome @Stackclash and maybe we will be coding together soon.

I have worked with Launch Code when they started here in STL but didn't have any luck with landing a pair coding position. I don't know what they are up to these days maybe I will have to get in touch e

I worked through the Harvard CS50 course in Winter 2014 with the group. With the recent news of Square opening an office in STL and hiring 200 over the next 5 years, I've been considering getting back in touch with LaunchCode.

Like probably the majority of you I'm trying to get my first job in programming. I'm trying to get my degree but like @cummns I had a kid and had to put that on the side for now. I'm just starting out with FreeCodeCamp, but another avenue I'm pursuing is Launch Code. Launch Code helps people of all skill levels to get a job in computer programming. I highly recommend it. They started here in STL but is quickly growing. [Launch Code](https://www.launchcode.org/)

I've finished the html and CSS because before code camp, I taught myself those two via YouTube. I am a whiz at WordPress sites and customizing themes but if I could not find a plugin to make the site function, I was lost...lol. I am diving into jquery because now I am learning something new and that is what motivates me to keep at it.

But I've had to step back for a bit because I'm doing two code camps at the same time and they split off a little bit.
