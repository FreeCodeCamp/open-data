I do want to keep this simple and keep his interactions in mind, which is why I am asking here! I am very aware of myself and know that I tend to put all feet forward at once and get a little dizzy, so my asking here is an attempt to help sort myself out and be able to start on the right foot and ask the right questions. To give you more of an idea about what he is looking for...this is an email from him regarding what he wants to do. And yes, you are reading right...""clown ministry"". He incorporates juggling and clowning into his ministry work. He is a rather fun guy. ""I envision two professional websites, one for my teaching & pastoral ministries, the other for my clown ministry. What I see as the link between them is a blog. If I decide it needs to be two blogs, I would like to link them to one another. I'd also like to link the blog(s) to my facebook page(s).I followed a friend more tech savvy than I and have been using WordPress. I'm not happy with what I have so far. I'd like to talk with you about what you'd charge to develop my sites. I know I am going to need to manage them in the future - but I also know managing it and designing it from the ground up are different tasks! Once designed and launched, a lot of this on the pastor/professor side becomes static with occasional updates (e.g. expanding the resource links) - and I'll want to do my own updating after launched."""

The fact that you have all these languages will help you when you run into issues and want to address them. CSS to add style for instance, so basically the tweaks to make it different. KISS Keep it Simple Stupid and as the user requirements grow and become different you can go of the defaults of Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal. I do not say it is the correct way, only a way... The user requirements is not clear and it is also not clear what the audience will be, once you create a simple map/drawing of it you can put the technologies behind it. Do not hit yourselve with a shovel up until you have clear requirements and understand them as complete as possible. At the end of it all the users that use the site and the services the site wish to provide will drive the requirements...

Since I have been studying web development (completed a part-time bootcamp a month ago), I am getting requests from friends/family to pay me to build them personal sites, blog sites, etc. My mother's pastor, in particular, is looking for a site that would mostly be static, but integrate two separate blogs he has going and wants to build upon. He would like to be able to make simple updates himself down the road and obviously add blog content on the regular. Having had my brain smooshed full of software development knowledge for months, I am finding that this is just different territory. I have a design background, so I think this would be a fun little project, but I am not sure what would be the best solution for him in terms of a hosting platform, CMS? I have no idea where to start looking. It sounds like he has played with wordpress and doesn't like it (still need to clarify if he is talking about wordpress.com vs .org) . The course I have been taking was primarily Ruby on Rails and a lot of backend stuff. We built web applications from scratch and deployed mainly to heroku. I am comfortable with HTML, CSS, JS to make this for him, but don't have any experience building something for a small client like this that would best suit him in the long term. I know enough to get a sense that the systems I have been learning wouldn't be best to implement for this project because what he wants is pretty simple and it needs to be friendly to him. Am I making sense? I would love some suggestions, feedback, etc?

Estimate how long it will take to make. So the math. There's your quote. A big thing newcomers always do is undervalue their services and take less than they could make.

If he is your first client , set the mark low, do not expect much profit , gradually increase the cost as your work quality increases.

Job's can be great for experience but I don't think they are the end game... I guess my question is, what is your endgame financially that 'knowing how to code' will help you get closer to ? if that makes sense
