Might the forum be better for that? Maybe. But you have to refresh the forum (sometimes) and what you write there it's up for the whole world to see. Here, you have more freedom, because finding organized data in chat rooms is more difficult than finding organized data in a forum."

You could have announced on those that unless the traffic in those would increase in the following month, they would be closed. Also, monthly checks could/should be made for those, but works even without those. Or, at least, ask the people what are the rooms they want the most (maybe count the links in the dicussions).
