We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

FCC focuses on the MEAN stack, like Prime did, and it is great for keeping my skills sharp. Plus, the project work will be great for my portfolio. The only thing that’s missing, in my opinion, is pair & group programming practice.

The one thing I'd suggest is to create your own little projects along the way. I'm not sure what the projects at the end entail, but it can't hurt to have other projects to display your problem-solving skills to a potential employer.

But there's a pretty big market for Ruby, too. I just studying the MEAN stack, so I'm a bit biased. I don't think you can go wrong with either of those, though. I'm not familiar with Meteor.

I am still very much a newbie. I now have some decent HTML and CSS knowledge and trying to build my Javascript knowledge. I will agree with you from my knowledge from my GF that contract is a nice place to go because the pay can be really nice and sometimes very long term anyways. Working remote would be great too! I would love to be looking for positions by the end of the here in the Minneapolis area.
