I work and have a relatively new baby, so most of my day time hours are booked. When the baby (and husband) sleep, I code for a couple of hours. I used to read and watch some Netflix each night, but now I spend the time on this. I've realized two (maybe conflicting) things: 1) For me, it's best to do a little each day. Even if it's just watching a youtube video of someone coding. It keeps it fresh in my mind. 2)I give myself time off. This summer, we traveled and I gave myself a month off. From time to time, I'll take two nights off in a row. Just keep chipping away, but also give yourself breaks. Good luck!!

It's great course and it's free (except you want its certification) The content was packed with quality. But there are a lot of issues in this course that you need to know before taking it;
1. It require you to learn a lot at the same time for example you need to complete ruby tutorial in one week plus git and bash command. Second week you have to try Rails , RSpec, Heroku etc.
2. The course pace is so fast. You need to be discipline to complete each week assignment.

This helps me stay on track and know where i left if I take a break or deviate from my task to fix some bug that I found out.
I've also been using Rescuetime that helps me have an overview of what I have done (How much time I spent doing some things) and I feel motivated to improve my productive/very productive time.

I took a break and switched to KhanAcademy, and their Javascript tutorials and challenges. Being able to do visual challenges where you results were immediately applicable to the canvas really helped me with retention and staying interested. When I came back to FCC I was much better able to remember the terminology and processes.

I'm really rather certain that the best way for me to go is to do _something_ at any given moment, keep moving, but it's hard. Seems a lot of the time I don't feel like anything, not even procrastinating. How do you deal with that, if anyone's been thinking along the same lines?

55ab70ea37f2ad22587e6202	FreeCodeCamp/SelfImprovement	2016-04-28T16:39:01.268Z	55a7c9e08a7b72f55c3f991e	qmikew1	57223ca5acbf59414aafddf0	yeah, that's hard to ignore... anything that's done regularly is prime for measurement (we all do that for everything esp those who love metrics) .  I think the initial question was more existential in nature (i.e.,  even if we're at peak efficiency are we 'happy'?) - bit of a tangent I guess lol. 
55ab70ea37f2ad22587e6202	FreeCodeCamp/SelfImprovement	2016-04-28T16:30:12.967Z	546ccc51db8155e6700d634d	SangSatori	57223a94acbf59414aafdd10	@qmikew1: It's something that I've always struggled with; even a few taps on an app whenever I carry out some action, when done regularly, accumulates to some mental overhead and ends up wearing me out quickly. At the same time, I really like the idea of paying attention to these metrics.
55ab70ea37f2ad22587e6202	FreeCodeCamp/SelfImprovement	2016-04-28T16:27:43.962Z	55a7c9e08a7b72f55c3f991e	qmikew1	572239ffc2f9b7fe41cbfa2b	Makes sense. Metrics as they relate to self- improvement are always a helpful tool, but they can, also, become one's master if not managed as a tool (distinction from self) - Thank you for the thoughtful response @SangSatori 
55ab70ea37f2ad22587e6202	FreeCodeCamp/SelfImprovement	2016-04-28T16:21:29.493Z	546ccc51db8155e6700d634d	SangSatori	57223889b8068d3e4aca2246	"@qmikew1: It's the practice of counting/keeping track of -  or ""quantifying"" - important metrics in one's life, which heavily depends on the person; the core idea is keep track of stuff that matters so one can use that information to develop more in the areas that need work. Or maybe just for data analysis fun."

In real estate investing we spent a lot of time building our buyers list of paying clients. which is just a list of people you can call if you need someone to sell to. I can apply that to web design and avoid the feat famine garbage. I'm gonna start taking 30 mins every day to work on my web design buyers list!

It is not efficient bt then you have 20% of task remaining(i.e. tweaking and making it efficient) and have 80% of time too(may vary). so its like for programming, make your program work-make it effective- i.e doing 80% of job, then make it efficient-and doing this takes lot of time, i know- and you have 80% time remaining for that,yay. hope you got my point and i wish you a happy new year

Rushed code usually ends up being rewritten or refactored heavily several times anyway for me, if I do go that way. What's your take on tweaking own efficiency at getting it done?"

It's less than perfect - no immediate feedback (browser doesn't refresh by itself), but might be one way to do it. I've only used some Nitrous in the past.

It seems to me most of these cloud IDEs are primarily for backend/service/API development - hence including the terminal and filesystem.

That's where scaffolding helps out the most, I think.
55ab70ea37f2ad22587e6202	FreeCodeCamp/SelfImprovement	2015-11-04T22:11:20.231Z	546ccc51db8155e6700d634d	SangSatori	563a82885680530d270469f7	It's good stuff. You can use it to scaffold, say, Angular projects and the like - front-end stuff. Saves manually setting up build tools every time and the like. Since I write my HTML with Jade and use LESS for my CSS, it needs the compilation step. Live-reload, file serve, minifying and other tasks done by Gulp are nice to have right away too.

If I split the components in repositories, that results in some 30-40 repositories for 'stuff'. They're almost all too big to take on right now.

Right now I think something smaller would be better - like my Yeoman generator, learning Rune.js or doing my site redesign, etc."

And then divide the work in small tasks. After that I decide which one has to be done first (or which one would I like to work on), and then I start.

But we haven't been able to find one that syncs well with Google Calendar and has both tasks and event items. We were thinking of working on it together, but would it be a bad idea to work with someone who's much more experienced on a project? I'm not sure how much I could contribute at this point. (He has a software engineering degree and works as a software engineer at a large corporation)

Also this book https://www.railstutorial.org/book might be useful if you're learning rails (I hope it is safe to assume that since you're learning ruby) (it also discusses testing). And the rails documentation is also pretty useful if you get stuck.

I still ended up going to a different psychiatrist than my state-sponsored one, paying a relatively hefty sum both for visiting the psychiatrist and the meds, but I'm not complaining. I'm from Latvia, Europe - so the procedure surely might differ.

I've never been diagnosed with ADHD but I suspect I have it. I've asked my primary care physician about this and they basically told me they don't prescribe or even diagnose ADHD at all but could refer me to some local places. The one place I called said I get tested but if I was diagnosed and wanted care, I would need to have weekly therapy sessions in order to continue to receive prescriptions for it. It seems like way too much of a hassle to even begin to treat on a medical level which I assume is exactly why my insurance does it this way.

I use basic tenets of GTD, are you familiar with that?

I don't use it anymore though.

If the typography of the website were more uniform it would look better - looks to me like there's 4 different fonts you're using to emphasize things (e.g. for the titles, subtitles and subscribe text). Also, it would be good to keep the images you use at a uniform size to make the whole blog look more cohesive.

They talked a bit about that in the Saturday Summit; they're going to only require half of those lessons in the future.  Definitely try to learn what you can from it (once you get a grasp of it, functional programming is very useful), but don't let it stop your momentum.

Would like to hare a resource for **goals management**. 
Here are the reasons why I like it:
* it's about SMART objective setting
* it's mostly free
* it's a nice place to find people with similar goals and interests
* there's application for iOS and Android.

Ever since I’ve been working with Free Code Camp (since last November) I’m content with a laptop and a wifi connection. The absolute best thing you can do to help yourself is help others.
