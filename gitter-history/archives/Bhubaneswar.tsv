##Please note that we now recommend campers use their Campsite’s Facebook group for chatting instead of their campsite’s Gitter chatroom. 
We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.

E.g. for an html like the following
```html
<h1>
    <p>Happy go lucky!</p>
    This is also replaced.
</h1>
```

Using  the following would replace anything inside `h1` tag with the text `Oops!`
```js
$('h1').html('Oops!');
```

Now the pg. would read like the following
```html
<h1>Oops!</h1>

We're creating a free Front End Development Certificate.

Here are the challenges that will make up our Basic Front End Development Certificate Program:

- HTML5 and CSS
- Responsive Design with Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Basic JavaScript
- Basic Bonfires
- Ajax and JSON APIs (not available in the current version of the [Map](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map))
- Zipline: Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage
- Zipline: Build a Random Quote Machine
- Zipline: Show the Local Weather
- Zipline: Build a Pomodoro Clock
- Zipline: Zipline: Use the Twitch.tv JSON API

This won't be a new curriculum - it will just be the first 400 hours of our full stack JavaScript curriculum.

All campers who have already completed these challenges will retroactively be eligible for the certificate.
