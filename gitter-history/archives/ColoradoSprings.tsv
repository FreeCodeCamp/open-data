If you clean your cache or use a different browser/etc, your old code will not show up.  However, if you go to your profile, the ""View My Solution"" should populate your submitted code.  If *that* is ever missing, it's a good time to submit an issue (if there isn't one currently open for the problem)"

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

55a0944b5e0d51bd787afdef	FreeCodeCamp/ColoradoSprings	2015-08-08T13:50:25.524Z	559ec06415522ed4b3e3bd9b	agamotto1	55c60921aac97ada66dd1fb5	Not yet, I posted it in the facebook page and there are quite a few people interested in it. I think we need to work together to figure out a time and place that would work for everybody. The only times I am available Mondays after 5, Fridays after 5 and over the weekend. 
55a0944b5e0d51bd787afdef	FreeCodeCamp/ColoradoSprings	2015-08-08T09:53:03.686Z	55a0da705e0d51bd787b03de	yogamonk	55c5d17f2ee3da6275c32de6	Oh good! I was just going to ask if we were still working on a local meet up. I'd love to participate in a few. I'm the only person I know that's learning code and would love to get around some people of various skill levels to discuss road markers and other things associated with learning this stuff. Any ideas for times and locations?

55a0944b5e0d51bd787afdef	FreeCodeCamp/ColoradoSprings	2015-07-26T01:44:12.995Z	559ec06415522ed4b3e3bd9b	agamotto1	55b43b6c61d39fd716066e82	Well when you get to the Bonfires and need to pair up with anybody let me know
55a0944b5e0d51bd787afdef	FreeCodeCamp/ColoradoSprings	2015-07-26T01:43:28.603Z	55b04df00fc9f982beaaa02a	Jason-McKenna	55b43b4061d39fd716066e7e	Gotcha - I totally get that. I was just wonder'n if there was one already - and there is apparently. So, I think I'll check it out eventually - once I get  a little further into the JS action on my end... maybe I'll see some other FCC CS folks there. ;)
55a0944b5e0d51bd787afdef	FreeCodeCamp/ColoradoSprings	2015-07-26T01:41:10.457Z	559ec06415522ed4b3e3bd9b	agamotto1	55b43ab6e923d83d6d46a3e4	That is pretty cool, I didn't know there was a CS JS group. The only problem with meetup.com is it costs money to create a meetup group or at least it did when I tried to set something up a while ago
55a0944b5e0d51bd787afdef	FreeCodeCamp/ColoradoSprings	2015-07-26T01:40:56.480Z	55b04df00fc9f982beaaa02a	Jason-McKenna	55b43aa861d39fd716066e72	Maybe that is more up everyone's alley?? I think this is something I'd be interested in checking out. Kinda wannuh meet folks and network a little and stay motivated locally I think. :) I get myt fill of the computer screen as it is lol ;) I'm sure you guys relate to that action.
55a0944b5e0d51bd787afdef	FreeCodeCamp/ColoradoSprings	2015-07-26T01:39:44.028Z	55b04df00fc9f982beaaa02a	Jason-McKenna	55b43a6069ee33730f445969	Thanks for your responses :)  Yes - I do have a LinkedIn page - and I do use Google Hangouts - so whatever works for others I suppose. I would think hangouts would be the easiest and provide the most effective communication - but again not sure how many folks like that sortuh gig ;). Up to you guys. I was thinking along the lines of Meetups more I guess - and I did find one her ein the Springs... lemme find it here... http://www.meetup.com/coloradospringsjs/

55a0944b5e0d51bd787afdef	FreeCodeCamp/ColoradoSprings	2015-07-24T16:51:41.534Z	559ec06415522ed4b3e3bd9b	agamotto1	55b26d1dbab860d81689df5c	We can absolutely look into that. Facebook is just a starting ground. Would Google Hangouts work for you?
55a0944b5e0d51bd787afdef	FreeCodeCamp/ColoradoSprings	2015-07-24T15:18:01.382Z	55b04df00fc9f982beaaa02a	Jason-McKenna	55b2572952d85d450f40042f	Hi agamotto1 :)  If we do not use Facebook (personal reasons - just don't like giving big bro all my life info), are there other ways to form/join meetups in our area - if anyone is into that sorta thing?  Any Google Hangouts or Meetup stuff going on? Not imperative of course, but might be cool for staying motivated during the process and making like-minded contacts...
55a0944b5e0d51bd787afdef	FreeCodeCamp/ColoradoSprings	2015-07-23T18:56:37.306Z	559ec06415522ed4b3e3bd9b	agamotto1	55b138e54fdc50987c73b106	How are you all doing? don't forget to check out out Springs FCC Facebook page as well!
