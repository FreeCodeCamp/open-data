Haven’t read them, but if theyre anything like the JS book, it’s worth a look. Also, there’s a series of small books called YDKJS (You Don’t Know JS) that you can get in paper form or free on GitHub. Get to it!

But the small milestones you hit will inspire you to stay on the road. I went to a full-stack bootcamp for 6 months and got hired as a junior developer working remotely for a really decent salary, but the company was so mis-mangaged and their implementation of Javascript (mostly jQuery) was so proprietary that what I was learning was never going to apply anywhere else. I quit and decided to get into freelancing and, at the same time, get back to a code school. I never finished the boot camp because I got that ill-fated job offer about halfway through. I stumbled on FreeCodeCamp and honestly, it’s the best program I’ve seen. I did Treehouse, Lynda, some Udemy courses, CodeSchool. Forget them. FreeCodeCamp is awesome. Well-organized, challenging but realistic. They don’t spoon feed you, but they give you more than enough information to hit Google and figure things out for yourself, and that’s really how you learn. To end, if you’re a total newbie at Javascript, you should go through “A Smarter Way to Learn Javascript” - a great workbook for beginners. After that, I recommend doing FreeCodeCamp and reading “Eloquent Javascript”…you’ll be well on your way after that.

I try to take my hour lunch at my desk with my laptop - i can get a couple tests done - or a half a chapter in a book (currently working through jquery in action and aws in action separately) then at home i try to get everything done as soon as iget hom....dinner if it's my turn to cook - and then i try to work until 8 pm so i don't stay at it too long - some nights it'll be longer (last night it was until about 8:45 due to my tests failing and focusing on the wrong issue, stupid nil class).  I do spend a lot of my weekend working when i can feel it (sometimes my mood works against me) - but i know with kids it gets harder

Sometimes (often) it’s all extremely overwhelming and I wonder what in the world I’m doing, trying to shimmy my way into a 20-something’s world!  However, the thought of ~25 more years of my “old” jobs motivates me to keep at it.  

I am actually going through a course at Udacity(.com) to help keep my learning path streamlined and on track. And even more motivated since I’m doing the paid route (you can get most of the courses for free, although I’m not sure if they’re updated as often as the paid versions, so basically you pay for feedback and support). Supposedly the course I just started will get me “job-ready” (complete with going through resume, cover letter, and online presence!). For me as a shy introvert, this sounds like the way to go, even if it’s only half true or I just barely pass.

In my mind, if you’re interested, you definitely should keep learning, and if you’re in a position to do it, go for it! There is a pretty big demand for computer skills of all kinds. I’ve read a few articles that have helped calm me down, haha. I’ve included a few in case they can help anyone else.

I have a baby and a job, so my time is limited. I like my current career, but would like to be able to work remotely (my husband's job requires frequent moves). It sounds like you've all committed to pursuing development as a next career. Will you share what makes you feel you can/should do so? I'm on the fence - telling myself I'll keep learning and keep getting information about the field, and then see.

***Red-Green-Refactor***
1.  Write your tests, run your tests, your tests will fail (Red)
2.  Write your code, run your tests, keep writing code until your code passes (Green).  The code doesn't have to be perfect or 'as you fully want it' - it just has to pass the tests
3.  Revise your code until it is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as you want it and as efficient as your want it (Refactor)

To me - that's the essentials of TDD (then again, when People talk about AGILE - I boil it down to the essence since I work on my own - *take a large project and break it down into small pieces and develop one small piece at a time that builds upon the previous pieces*, it sort of dovetails well with TDD.  

In fact - that's important - don't write ALL your tests at once - pick something you want to make work - write the tests for that - they'll pass - then write more tests - and yes this will make things take longer, but it will also make things stronger as your app grows - say you're two months in and you build something that breaks something you built a month ago - without testing you wouldn't know - but since you've been running your entire code listings after every new function is built - you'll know when you've broken something

Plus - i've talked to a few interviewers (not for job interviews but at meetups) and when I mentioned I had a project I didn't have tests for yet because I hadn't been able to figure them out (http://www.github.com/jemagee/nba) I was told the first thing most interviewers do to look at a project is to look at the tests.  Said project now has testing on it)"

It had a small portion of the course that familiarized the students with it. It was a challenging and rewarding way to learn.
55ca87910fc9f982bead115c	FreeCodeCamp/40PlusDevs	2016-08-12T13:26:46.183Z	5593494515522ed4b3e32233	jemagee	57adce9646a301fa5a4943b9	@vkeegan  That depends on what platform you're using.  FCC isn't my start, so I came into TDD via a different platform (Ruby on Rails) and most tutorials on that platform include TDD - ROR comes with built in testing but there's a better system for me called RSpec that I can use with something called Capybara - there are a few books and things that focus on RSpec out there

While I don't use RoR, I think DHH is the most interesting speaker (clearly just my opinion). Every Monday morning, I look forward to a new video on YouTube by mpj - [FunFunFunction](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q). Most of the [hack summit 2016](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hack+summit+2016) talks were excellent. David Malan teaching [CS50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFenJJtAEzE&list=PLhQjrBD2T383Xfn0zECHrOTpfOSlptPAB) at Harvard was the best introduction course to CS I've had and a big reason why I've kept the dream alive of being a software engineer / web developer.

I work in Ruby on Rails, and I work with TDD, it took me a long time where even building out the basic CRUD functions didn't require a lot of looking things up, reviewing things, now though it probably still takes me longer than others, I can do it a lot more instinctively - repetitiion really takes time.  

As for the silo issue - trust me i get it - i tried local meetups - but they don't work for me - most of the members already have jobs in tech or are hobbyists just for fun - i have  a hard time finding those hard core fully employed looking to make a change types - this is the career path i want to be on - i know that - i just have to figure out how to get there.  I started FCC as a lark to get unstuck on other things but the gitter rooms might provide some salvaation - any, even simple, projects people want to work on via github would be cool - i've always thought a good beginner JS/Jquery project would be an RPG character generator."

Personally, the time it takes to setup TDD is paid back in a whole host of other ways.  eg It forces you to focus on the outcome and not wast time on side issues (once the test passes it is done!).  You cannot do automated testing and continuous delivery without TDD (actually it becomes very difficult without TDD)."

Finding an open source project that suits me is rather difficult - and most of the web sites that purport to help you find open source projects to work on are pretty badly maintained -

Someone mentioned an ERP earlier up there - those aren't exactly easy to build - but starting with a basic ordering system (without inventory tracking just yet) might be a good place to start?

Primarily have been focused on back-end development with ruby on rails, i have a [variety of projects](http://www.github.com/jemagee) in process that anyone is welcome to pick up.  Started the FCC a couple days ago because if you do look at my projects you'll notice a severe lack of front end development.  It's the bane of my programming existence - laying stuff out - i'm the type who doesn't really worry about look and feel and cares more about function.  I've run through the first few course (i'm about 2/3 of the way through JS) because I have learned a lot of it before (and often sadly), in hopes of moving my brain forward on layout / user interaction stuff as opposed to base functionality I've been doing.  The thing I find hardest is finding 'others' to work with.  Working full time (45-50 hours a week) in something that has nothing to do with tech and THEN taking time after work, during lunch, and on weekends makes this a long process  - i'd love to be able to move into something soon but not sure how to go about it

I'm in the privileged position of working with a dozen programmers, some of them are proper 'rocket surgeons' and even then, since many of them are younger than me I have still landed the role of 'Software Release Manager' even though I can't write code. Why is that? Well, it appears we older individuals end up bringing some qualities to the table that even the most prolific software craftsman sometimes lacks.

1) User empathy. While it's great that the application works in way x, y, z it's often forgotten that the User is NOT the developer. The developer is happy, the user is like WTF?
2) COMMUNICATION... The ridiculous importance of this skill cannot be measured. Asking the right question, in the right way to understand exactly what the implications are for a specific implementation detail? Gold, seriously. I could write a book about the importance of this to the point where I've got MANY examples of developers spending weeks on creating exactly the wrong thing because they simply assumed and utterly failed to ask any questions or get feedback. It's awful hard to throw out weeks of work for want of a 10 minute conversation
3) Humility. The fact that you don't know it all (no-one knows it all) means you're not going to be blind to the realisation and I believe for this reason you'll actually write better code, that you understand properly, which has tests.
4) Having survived to this rip old age (yeah, yeah) we do, in most cases, know how to weigh up a decision and then communicate as to why it's going to be done this way. In other words, leadership. In many cases it's as important that a decision gets made as to what the decision is. Decisions can be changed later when more data appears but in the meantime perfection is a myth and prediction is a waste of time. 
5) If you understand the toolchain (Git, Jenkins, test suites, deployment) and can spend time automating it you'll be doing extremely valuable work which developers appreciate but in many cases find boring. It's not! Just make tools or automate basic stuff using Powershell and people will love you, even when your code isn't spectacular. (you might be able to tell this is what I'm doing)
6) Write documentation for what you're doing - save someone else the job, again, someone out there will LOVE you for this

In short, since you're older you have great communication skills, excellent bullshit detection features and automagically have the capacity to provide some leadership. Learning to code and adding more value on top of all this? Priceless.

Also, as a final note. It matters not one whit whether this takes you 6 months, 1 year or two (more?) 'cause eventually you will get there and become legendary.   "

I am a newbie here, with qualification to join (40YC - 40 years old club). I just want to throw few ideas here, hopefully it will make us more motivate to learn and implement our knowledge gained from FCC.

1. What if we change the vision from looking for jobs to create jobs?

2. We can start by converting popular business application which already open source to stacks we learn from FCC. For example, we can convert an ERP called Oodo to use NodeJS instead of Python and keep open source it so community can take advantage. We can make a profit by customising package to organisation/business owner who need it.

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoo and https://www.odoo.com

If you have several ideas, inline with point number 1, go ahead, spill it up and keep this topic float.

3. Why NodeJS ? I think @QuincyLarson, can give more explanation about this. I read in Medium or Quora that FCC and popular corporation like PayPal use NodeJS, there are also other area which maybe NodeJS may not fit into situation like point no.2 above.
Btw, how many of you already pass Front End Development ?

Keep the spirit up!"

I had to keep the projects away!  We need to focus on what we CAN do.  I was lucky this year a colleague gave me a few projects.  Two Wordpress sites and one Drupal Migration.  Now I made it work, but it took me WAY longer than I expected it.  For the wordpress, as I cant do the perfect HTML or bootstrap yet I used one of those super themes Divi.  Have you heard of it?  I have to say the CMS scene has changed QUITE a bit (for the good) in the past 13 years.  I first tried Mambo in 2005 (Joomla!).

Especially the tip that when you reach a point where nothing no longer makes sense, go backwards until the info is just review, then head forwards again. Sometimes that's where an important lesson wasn't learned.

It was initially geared towards learning difficult subjects like math and science, but its for general learning as well.(languages, programming,e tc).  One of the resons I recommend the course is that it helped me view both my learning and career path in a different light.  We are told if we focus like a laser on a subject and live and breathe it, you will learn it, but that's not how learning happens in the brain at all.  This and many more lessons are part of why I loved it.  Here is the link. Its free! https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn

Plus I get REALLY intimidated/nervous/blank-minded in interviews - not a good combo!  I’ve decided to more generally go the look-at-my-portfolio route. A major reason I joined this site is because they provide actual projects for learning on, that will actually be used by non-profits. Something you can show employers and say you did that (or helped)! It’s always easier to learn by doing. Good luck to you!

Are you newcomers to programming and Web Development, or coming to it from working in another language? For myself I've been programming casually and for pleasure for a few years now, started with Java and then some C# / .net.   Always been in technology of some kind though,  electronics and research instrumentation, and telecommunications, and recently IT for the local school board.

--- An special Spotify with NO electronic or hip-hop
--- A help line chat for middle-age crisis (we can ask @dcsan to implement a bot for FAQ)
--- A as fast as possible cruise booking system

Please remember that freecodecamp is a work in progress.  We have dedicated people checking problem areas and working constantly to improve the program. Please don't give up.  The wiki is brand new and it will take some time for campers to fill out the hints and helps.  I'm intending to add some really basic help for people with no coding experience to the wiki as soon as I figure out how it works, lol. Because I am struggling myself, I am hoping i can help other beginners. If you are stopped at on of the early bonfires, perhaps the Khan academy course on algorithms at https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms can help you stay in the game and progress. Also please feel free to invite me to pair with you (maryann573@gmail.com) as I need to go over all these again to really understand them, and working it through with someone else would help me immensely.
