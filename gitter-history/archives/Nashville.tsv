We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.

I like TreeHouse for learning new things, they give you a solid base.  However, I cant actually do the things on my own when I finish.. like I kind of know.  Thats what good about FCC, it is less forgiving and a little brutal, but you do learn more becxause you have to!  I use both resources.  TreeHouse has a Full Stack JavaScript Track that goes along well with FCC... when I am feeling inspired I work on FCC prijects, when I am feeling beat down I go learn on the TreeHouse tutorials.  Feel free to hit me up on Twitter or email dalrymp6@gmail.com.  I am in McKenzie which is kind of far, but I would love to meet up!

I like FCC so far, as the bonfires make you think.  This is critical in learning how to solve problems as you go on and try to make it a career.

Also, loving what you're writing in your blog. Seems like we've been jumping some of the same hurdles, I just started two weeks behind. Would you recommend that I get into CodeAcademy and TreeHouse?

I just started FCC yesterday and sadly I’m already stuck - if anyone has a moment to offer some advice - that would be awesome…

I am working on Waypoint: Add Images to your Website
(done) Your page should have an image element.
(here is where I am stuck) Your image should have have a src attribute that points to the kitten image.

The kitty image does display in the example - which I assume it would not if the src attribute was incorrect - so I don’t know what I am missing

here is a link to a screen shot: http://bit.ly/1LrvXt0

Thanks :)"
