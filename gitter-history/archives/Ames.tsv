560a52ec0fc9f982beb22a9f	FreeCodeCamp/Ames	2016-02-03T22:26:30.781Z	55e1fe8b0fc9f982beaf050c	amuhs	56b27e965245f2e110e72242	@iglesias23 Welcome! We are glad you joined. I’m not sure if you can see any of the previous comments on here or not but just to let you know, we are not a very active group. I would like to change that soon, but like most of the other people in the group, I am still a busy student. If you want to plan a meet up feel free to post it on here and/or the Facebook page (not a lot of people check here). If you just want to go through the exercises without meet ups that’s cool too. If you need any help feel free to post in either place and someone would be happy to help.

I just wanted to to introduce myself, and I can see my facebook request for the group was accepted so yay! I'm pretty new at this coding thing (currently learning c++ because of my job, and have some experience in python, html, and css). 
560a52ec0fc9f982beb22a9f	FreeCodeCamp/Ames	2015-11-23T22:38:43.338Z	55e1fe8b0fc9f982beaf050c	amuhs	56539573acb264dc163ac824	@taylorcoreyd I’d try asking on the facebook page, not many look at anything on here. We haven’t had any meet ups, most are busy students so I’m not sure if anyone is working on anything other than homework and the FCC curriculum.

I wasn't sure if you guys already had projects ongoing or were still learning. I don't have a formal CS background so I would benefit from either of those presently. I'll be sure to stay connected.

If you ever want to get together with a group to work on the FCC exercises or a project feel free to post on facebook to set something up.

I finished a 12 week program for Ruby on Rails dev before I found Free Code Camp. I'm hoping the Ames group is active, I'm excited for the opportunity to work on a project with a team!

I don't know if anyone will see this for awhile, but I'm new to Code Camp and am from Ames. Just wanted to stop by to introduce myself. I requested to be added to the Facebook group as well.
