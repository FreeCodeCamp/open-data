There are a ton of 3-5 years required (GA says to apply to jobs up to 3 years experience). And a lot of companies don't even know what these coding bootcamps are. I went through a few rounds at Amazon and the team had no idea what General Assembly was or what coding bootcamps were.

I guess that really isn't true if half of your class is still not employed. I wonder what that really says about the software industry. I remember hearing about how some company went to the government demanding that they relax the visa requirements because there weren't enough skilled IT workers in the US. Then the next day laid off several thousand people. I think that I heard it was Oracle. But, I could be mistaken. I know that I've been applying for at least 8 jobs a week for the last 10 months and I haven't heard much back. Just a few phone calls.
I had an pre-interview with AIM Consulting. I went all the way there from Seattle to find out that I was interviewing for a position that was suspended. I have had a few calls from Prime Team Partners but, that's just the pre-interview stuff. I've had a few calls from TekSystems but, eventually, I called them up and told them to not contact me anymore. (It was a weird situation ... they would constantly call me but wouldn't follow-up. I had 4 phone calls where they said that they were going to send me an online assessment for Linux Administration. Four times they didn't send it. I had to beg one recruiter to send me the assessment. I went home to try and do it.. Didn't work on my Linux system. It needed to be ran in Windows with Internet Explorer 10+.) ... Interesting state of employment within our industry."

When I went they had statistics of 95%-ish placement in 3 months and 100% in 6 months, but the data set was only about 40 people. I finished at the end of December and less than half my class has a position (and another 2 classes have finished since then and another about to finish plus 4 other dev bootcamps in Seattle). Code Fellows used to have a $60K position in 9 months or refund, but they had to give so many refunds that they recently restructured and got rid of that policy.

Introducing myself since I’m new to the group. I’m using FreeCodeCamp to brush up on basics, learn a few new things (maybe React) and evaluate the resource for other designers in our studio. Hope to connect with you all as I make my way through the materials.

I just sent you maybe like seven or eight proposals & I landed my first gig the next day. If you have solid examples of work & write out proposals that show confidence in your skills then you should be good. Just take the time to research the clients through their profiles and then spend time on the proposals, don't copypasta them for best results.

They basically bring you in, ask you questions about your background then you show them work examples & they will later send you skill tests they expect you to take. They will also ask for references so those can help.   I would just give it a shot if I were you & you have some example projects to show.

I took a class and taught myself HTML and CSS in 1997. I developed my high schools website at the time.  And later became the web master for an advanced elective. In 1998, I tutored a lady on web development to the point where she was able to get a job. I've been on and off doing web coding for a long time. From 1998 to 1999 and again 2001 to 2003, I took a vocational training course first for Culinary Arts; second for Computer Service Technician. I would use a notebook and write code by hand (pencil/paper). Then I would take the code to the computer lab to type up. (I even have a few defunct websites in my portfolio.)
My career path: 
2003 - 2004 Tier 3 Technical Support; 
2005 - 2007 Customer Service; 
2007 - 2008 Technical Customer Service (Speciality Department);
2008 - 2010 Technical Support Analyst / Jr. Network Administrator;
2010 - 2012 Community College: Network Design and Administration; 
2012 - 2015 System, Network, Database and Help Desk Administrator (IT Administrator/Manager) [I was a department of one. Me.] 
Current: Network Operations Center Administrator
I've kind of been all over the map with my IT knowledge. And they say, as your career grows, it will continue to grow in that direction. I'm just trying to get a solid foothold and focus. Hopefully, be a valuable asset somewhere. I like the idea of moving my Systems Administration knowledge to the development side via system automation and rapid system deployments while having a sub-focus of web development. Eventually, I'd like to move completely to the side of IT that I've always enjoyed. Solving problems with code. But, that is feeling like I'm making a huge career change. Overall, I'd just like to work for a company that allowed me to to have amazing learning opportunities and grow within an amazingly collaborative team environment that offered mentor ship and coaching. Sadly, I'm currently in a role that is very limiting. I've been -talked-to-about-my-github- by my current employer for putting code online in my free time. (This is due to a Ownership Of Intangible Property clause in my employment contract: All processes, inventions, patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intangible rights that may be conceived or developed by Employee, either alone or with others, during the Employment Term, whether or not conceived or developed during Employee's working hours.) This really limits and stifles my personal career advancement process. While, I'm limited by my current employer in more ways that I've listed. I'm still trying to do what I can, while I don't own a laptop and I can't attend free coding classes that require you have a laptop, I am still taking free online classes to improve my own learning process. It would just be really helpful and amazing to be able to sit side by side with other coders. Hopefully, some day, I'll be able to save up for a laptop.
That, or, I'd love to just get in a sail boat and sail away while living off some magical funds that are always flowing into my awesome bank account."

Then it strips out non word chars and underscores.  Then it pushes the cleaned string into an array and compares the [0]th and [-1]th positions of the array.  If those two are equal, then it removes the [0]th and [-1]st elements of the array and repeats that process unti the array is empty and returns true (meaning str was a palindrome), else it returns false (meaning str wasn't a palandrome).

That said, there is certaintly a range of specialization you can take in “front-end development” – knowing HTML/CSS in depth is something a lot of JS developers overlook, so there’s room for all, but you have to be really specific about what you’re looking for and if the company has a position for that.

If anyone wants to do something like that, check in on that board. We’ll likely try to get together every couple weeks.

The boot-camps online will continue because it allows you to have a full time job and study on the side. Its those who put in the extra effort(doing more than what the course ask) that will find those jobs. I work full time, take 1-2 classes a quarter at Everett Community College and study web development on the side. I know all my hard work will pay off someday.

559399cb15522ed4b3e326b2	FreeCodeCamp/Seattle	2016-01-03T00:51:01.547Z	55c3cdc30fc9f982beac81be	pwolter	568870750199d70069e0a4b8	@freefora11 That is a great advice! I also follow lots of video tutorials (and just reading tutorials as ell) and what I did not like too much is the lack of challenge they offer to really test your learning. Unless of course you are extremely disciplined … which I’m not.
559399cb15522ed4b3e326b2	FreeCodeCamp/Seattle	2016-01-02T23:38:33.704Z	5660f01a16b6c7089cbd509c	freefora11	56885f79653b30761d770885	For a while, I would just follow along with video courses, but was never given challenges to test if I really know the stuff. This is why I love FCC! I have no doubt that as soon as I am done with FCC, I will be qualified to get a web development job.
559399cb15522ed4b3e326b2	FreeCodeCamp/Seattle	2016-01-02T23:37:07.410Z	5660f01a16b6c7089cbd509c	freefora11	56885f234f069158055cc14b	@fhergomez so a thing I would recommend is  watching a video course along with FCC.  This is how I see it: I use video tutorials or courses as if I were going to a college class. Then I use FCC as my homework and applying things I have learned(plus FCC teaches(I consider it review) those concepts as well).  Then after being burnt out doing bonfires or a zipline, I finish the day reading a chapter in a web development book.

It teaches you a lot but once you come to your first zipline, they force you to do your own learning and research. Trust me I struggled a lot at the beggining. But I can tell you that once you finish the first site, everything becomes a lot easier. I ended up learning bootstrap which took a while for me, but it made it easier cause the website became a lot better since now it worked well on mobile. You can always go back and update your site with new things you learn.

There are so many things already built in it & I'm contacted usually twice a week about some kind of job involving Angular. Honestly I've learned it's better to not worry about the frameworks, just get good at JS & learning in general & you can pick any of them up.

I know HTML and CSS quite well. So, I'm trying to push myself back into development. I've dabbled in a bunch of stuff: VBS, ASP, PHP & C++. (Hadn't ever really solidified anything.) I took a college class for C# and Hand-coded XHTML/CSS. I did the Microsoft Virtual Academy for Python.
I've kind of been all over the map with my IT knowledge. I'm just trying to get a solid foothold and focus. Hopefully, be a valuable asset somewhere.

You want to make sure you don't give yourself any titles like Jr, Mid, Sr on your resume & if you haven't already you should have it uploaded to Dice, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, Monster, & LinkedIn. If you don't have a portfolio you're gonna need that & you may honestly have to bs your experience some & then try being honest in the interviews because some recruiters are going to insta disqualify you if you don't meet requirements.

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

Like I said we are already on the intermediate front end projects (and we've been trying to use DOM instead of jQuery). I know my class was more selective and had a waiting list, but I don't know about the PT courses if you're getting sales calls. There is a job support team. Something like 96% are employed in 90 days and 100% in 180 days. You have to figure that some people won't be as strong as other people though, so I'm not really worried about the job thing.

I was under the impression that they were a little money grabby because I requested some info for a course just thinking that they would put me on a mailing list and I started to get sales calls from them. I see that they at least try to appear to try to help with job placement - so I have thought about considering them again.

I talked with a few alumns who loved the front-end accelerator and some of the coolest sounding projects were ones where the front-end class worked together with the python, ruby, or javascript class to products with professional level UIs, so I hope they'll add that program back too.

And it is saying all cars have 4 wheels. That's it. Then you make an object that is called myCar that is inheriting everything from car (it turns out only to be inheriting the number of wheels). 
559399cb15522ed4b3e326b2	FreeCodeCamp/Seattle	2015-09-14T23:04:58.865Z	559e9ddc15522ed4b3e3bb44	thomasvaeth	55f7529a18e0111d7e4ed810	So you would do myCar.engines = 1 or however many engines you want.

The only downside of the OpenWeatherMap was I couldn't find a list of all the possible weather -> main outputs (I thought I did, but then a random description will come back), so I had to use the icon output instead. Not as accurate, but it still does what needs to be done.

In case anybody is having sudden issues and is being driven insane like I was--try looking for another API that is similar or combining a find-IP API with an IP-to-city/state/ZIP API.

The problem I am having now is I set the clock to 30 minutes, but when I hit start it is still coming up as 25 minutes. But if I hit stop, change the time to something like 35 minutes and hit start the clock will be at 30 minutes. I have a variable out of order somewhere.
559399cb15522ed4b3e326b2	FreeCodeCamp/Seattle	2015-09-07T03:03:51.922Z	54e6759815522ed4b3dc39ae	denmch	55ecfe978018a82e1940d212	@thomasvaeth Do you mean reset when it's all done, or giving the user the option to reset? I did the latter. If they used clearInterval, then it sounds like they used setInterval, which is unreliable. You should use setTimeout and clearTimeout. setInterval will try to run specified code when it's time, and if it can't, then oh well.
559399cb15522ed4b3e326b2	FreeCodeCamp/Seattle	2015-09-07T02:04:04.840Z	559e9ddc15522ed4b3e3bb44	thomasvaeth	55ecf0942e48d88a543dc004	@denmch I asked in the help section earlier and they all said they used clearInterval and just reset all the variables after.

I figured that I could copy that code and change the timer to 25 min. But I'm not sure what the pomodoro app requires

 ```
<div id=""timer"">
  <span id=""minutes"">25<span> : <span id=""seconds"">00<span>
</div>

I resize to 1920 pixels x whatever the ratio is and it drops it down to 250 KB. But CodePen can't do that. And the JSON stuff wasn't working on GitHub preview. CodePen is growing on me though seeing all the CSS other people are doing.

I used the same HTML and CSS as my random quote machine. I had some trouble doing switch/case, so I have a fairly long if/else statement. And I could toggle classes on my buttons for some reason.

I heard about it as an alternative to FTP ok ShopTalk but haven't found many resources about setting it up or using it. I think it's ruby and command line. But that's all I've figured out so far.

If you've spent between 30 minutes to an hour commuting to go work complete isolated while right next to people sharing very similar interests to you, youre kinda doing it wrong haha

It technically affects the parent div of the left well. But you want your css to apply to the left well by selecting one of its children and using `.parent()`.

I am James, I have enough coding experience to fill a thimble, but I really am trying to learn.  I have been through a bootcamp at codefellows on JS and a bit of jQuery.  I am interested in learning more and am wondering if anyone has any pointers or preferred lessons online.

The HTML/CSS s and the JavaScript & Jquery  titles are both gems. I can't recommend the JS/Jquery one enough. In fact, I recently bought it for my younger brother who is trying to get his foundation established.

Has anyone  used this book? I'm off to a rough start with jQuery http://lifehacker.com/javascript-jquery-a-more-beautiful-way-to-learn-web-1721108479

I’m reaching out (cold-call style) to some experienced programmers in the area to see if they would like to drop by and help our group whenever they can. Last meetup we had a good mix, which was great!
559399cb15522ed4b3e326b2	FreeCodeCamp/Seattle	2015-07-30T20:18:28.868Z	54e6759815522ed4b3dc39ae	denmch	55ba8694a0587bc54d68bec2	@thatguynef Yeah, I agree. I don't think anything too formal is necessary, especially given the venue. I think more people will be encouraged to come out if there's no pressure, but I just wanted to point out that pairing is arguably better if people aren't on equal footing. It gives more advanced students a chance to hone mentoring skills, and those nearer the beginning the advantages of learning from someone and getting past common hurdles.

The challenge with organizing is not knowing who will show up each week. It seems to me that we will have to play it based on attendance. What do you think?

If you enjoy web development, by all means, its a really nice area. Well paid and motivating... but know that you also have to enjoy learning bacause everything changes so quickly that you are going to see yourself having to pick up new things all the time.

I know there are at least two people in Olympia, but I don't know about any meetings. I think it'd be a great idea to start an Olympia group (that'd be the biggest city in the area, right?) and see if people start joining.

He takes you from A-Z on building website. From idea, wire framing and  to coding the design. Good stuff, highly recommend.
