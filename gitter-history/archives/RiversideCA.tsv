Let me know if your interested.

55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-10-10T16:58:00.858Z	5618a70bd33f749381a8e75c	randytorres	5619439899bbd76f0f30b10f	any locals going through the program? how far are you?

55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-08-18T00:55:39.943Z	55d25b470fc9f982beadb259	MatiosTV	55d2828b35e3e09b3adb2bab	Even though I said that earlier.  I had the thought again as if it was foreign.  I think this is the most excited I've been to drain my battery to 2% and plug it in to recharge while I use it.
55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-08-18T00:55:05.299Z	55d25b470fc9f982beadb259	MatiosTV	55d282693d8917890c167aac	This is just too fun.
55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-08-17T23:18:50.064Z	55d25b470fc9f982beadb259	MatiosTV	55d26bda204de35b42308639	Lol!!  We'll see!  I've already had to google something.  This is fun though.
55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-08-17T22:57:21.270Z	55a44cc15e0d51bd787b4932	queenlizo	55d266d1204de35b4230858d	You'll get there soon enough.  The first sections don't take too long.  At least they didn't used to.  lol
55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-08-17T22:55:58.466Z	55d25b470fc9f982beadb259	MatiosTV	55d2667e255950880cfbf217	I can't wait to get there!  I found a discussion thread with the 7 best free JavaScript books.  Can't wait to crack them open, but I wanna wait until I reach that part of the curriculum
55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-08-17T22:34:25.805Z	55a44cc15e0d51bd787b4932	queenlizo	55d261719b45e15c4264a3c1	I'm really enjoying FCC.  The bonfires are particularly good at helping you learn JavaScript.
55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-08-17T22:33:41.726Z	55d25b470fc9f982beadb259	MatiosTV	55d26145057d8c9d3a6dcd4b	Ah I see.  I Love the format.  I did Codecademy a loooong time ago and I Loved it.  But I found myself stuck really.  The projects were cool, but I kind of wanted to build something or be involved in building something and didn't really know where to go
55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-08-17T22:32:16.588Z	55a44cc15e0d51bd787b4932	queenlizo	55d260f035e3e09b3adb282f	I'm not sure.  I've been on here about 5 weeks.
55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-08-17T22:31:50.595Z	55d25b470fc9f982beadb259	MatiosTV	55d260d635e3e09b3adb282b	@queenlizo Oh wow!  So is updating the curriculum something they do often?  That is absolutely amazing.
55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-08-17T22:30:35.179Z	55a44cc15e0d51bd787b4932	queenlizo	55d2608b9b45e15c4264a3a0	@MatiosTV cool!  They just revamped the curriculum.  It's definitely more intensive now.  I'm redoing the HTML part to review and to do the new sections
55a5ff8c5e0d51bd787b6ca5	FreeCodeCamp/RiversideCA	2015-08-17T22:21:21.954Z	55d25b470fc9f982beadb259	MatiosTV	55d25e6235e3e09b3adb27d7	Just got started  on the code camp!  @queenlizo Very excited to do some work!
