We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

I joined FCC to learn about nodejs, express and mongodb....but I started from the beginning because I need to review css and javascript ( I am a bit weak when it come to front end programming).
