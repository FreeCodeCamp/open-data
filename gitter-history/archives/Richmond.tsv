Lost my login and I'm restarting all over again. Repetition is good, right? Been coding for years, firstly in Ohio Scientific Superboard 2 basic at home then cobol as a programmer. Also worked with Quickbasic, QBasic, C, Turbo Pascal, RPG2, C# 1.0 to 10, Java for Android. Currently Data Engineer for Marketing company. Mainly SQL Server and ETL  development.

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

We have a Facebook page set up: https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.floyd.virginia/

Unfortunately my mode of transportation recently hit the dust so I won't be able to attend any Lynchburg-local meets.

I've completed everything up to the first several bonfires that are recommended for team coding. I've had  trouble with their recommended screen share app and would like to do some live team coding.

As for advice, I'm not sure how they generally work. I suppose it depends on where everyone is at on FCC. I imagine it would be especially useful for people in the BaseJump phase of FCC program, as that's where (I think) the web-apps become complex and use full MEAN stack.

Also, sorry for the delayed response. I have my notifications in Lurk Mode, and I mainly check the main page and the HelpZiplines page"

I'm in Lynchburg we do a lot of apprenticeships (www.sharptop.co/apprenticeships/) and are thinking about starting a Lynchburg camp site.  Would you guys or any one else be interested in learning programming near Lynchburg?
