I am backtracking into some waypoint stuff. they added a new object oriented programming lesson that I am now undertaking.

Let me know if any of this is unclear or if you have any other questions. And don't fret -- there is a lot to learn when you're starting out, but once you get the basic gist of how things need to be laid out, called, etc. You'll get into the swing of things and will be able to focus more on the problem solving rather than on code structuring. 

Just hang in there and keep at it. You'll get it in no time :-)

And don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it -- we were all starting out at one point, and we're all still learning!

Here are a few things to get you moving further in the right direction -- I think they will have the added benefit of helping to clarify how a lot of the code you're going to be writing will work. 

---------------------------------------------------------

First of all, you need to put all the things that you want your code to ""do"" inside the function's curly braces (if you only have one function -- which is the case with most of these first projects). So,  your functions should be something like this:

```
function FUNCTION_NAME (arguements) {
    //do some stuff here

    //do some more stuff here

    // maybe return something here -- note that when you return something, it halts execution of the function you're in 
    // In other words, when you return, you're done --  so always return a value *after* you have done everything else you need to do.
    // As a note, you'll actually be able to use this to your advantage in the future in case you'd like to halt execution in certain
    // circumstances and avoid executing the rest of the code in a function.
}
```
then, below that, you'll ""call"" your function and ask it to do its thing on whatever input you are supposed to provide to it (the arguments)

Those calls will look something like this:

`FUNCTION_NAME(arguments);`

---------------------------------------------------------
So....
As a first step to fix the code that you posted, you'd want to reorganize it like this:
---------------------------------------------------------
```
function reverseString(str) {
     str = ""hello"";
     arr = str.split("""");
     arr.reverse();

    return str;
}


reverseString(""hello"");
```

----------------------------------------------------------
Now, the above code is in the right place, but it still isn't going to work at this point. You've got a few more things you need to do....
---------------------------------------------------------

First of all,  you don't need to/you shouldn't define a value for `str` -- that value is what you are passing in as an argument to the function. So, when you call:
`reverseStr(""hello"");` that passes `""hello""` into your function and assigns it to `str` and you can use it right away without any further work on your part. 

And,since it's not hard-coded into your function, you can subsequently call 
`reverseStr(""foo bar"");` and when the function runs from that call, `str` will equal `foo bar` -- basically, coding it like this makes your code reusable and you can call it on different values and have it do the same thing to each value (but you only have to write the code once)

---------------------------------------------------------
Then, when you create a new variable, you need to use `var` in front of it (there are other options you may use in the future, but for now, `var` is a good choice. So, when you define your new array, you'll want to do it like this:
`var arr = str.split("""");`

That will create a new array called `var` and will populate it with the individual characters from `str` -- you're halfway there now!

---------------------------------------------------------
Next, you reverse the array -- you're already doing that correctly.

---------------------------------------------------------

Then, you've got to get that back into a String to return (because part of the spec of the Bonfire is that ""Your result must be a string.""). To do that, you can use the Array.join() method. You want to pass that an empty string, just like you did for Array.split(). And, you'll need to assign the result to a new String that you can return from your function. So that would look something like this:

`var newStr = arr.join("""");`
		
---------------------------------------------------------
Now `newStr` should have the split, then reversed, then re-joined version of `str` that you passed into the function when you called it. 

All that's left to do is return the `newStr` variable, and you should be set. 

---------------------------------------------------------
