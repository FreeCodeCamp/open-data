However, the current best practice is still to use some type of transpiler for cross-browser compatibility.

5593996715522ed4b3e32699	FreeCodeCamp/SaltLakeCity	2016-07-08T19:11:51.600Z	550a359115522ed4b3dd7a98	metasean	577ffaf7c9b49c1d6fddfcaa	Definitely an interesting twist!

I decided to use the coding opportunity to sharpen my skills using emmet shortcuts in Sublime Text 3.
5593996715522ed4b3e32699	FreeCodeCamp/SaltLakeCity	2016-07-07T21:48:15.055Z	550a359115522ed4b3dd7a98	metasean	577ece1f7aeb0805277469ea	Once you hit the html and css, if you've got any experience - yep, you'll be bored silly!

5593996715522ed4b3e32699	FreeCodeCamp/SaltLakeCity	2016-07-07T21:47:08.942Z	550a359115522ed4b3dd7a98	metasean	577ecddc064f828707db0f73	"Absolutely, although as you've seen it isn't obvious.  Open your map, you'll see all of the difference challenges, projects, etc.  Just click on the title of the one you want to do, and you're there :smile: 

Caveats: 
(1) If you want to get one of their certifications, you need to do all the activities with asterisks next to them.
(2) When you finish an activity, it will take you to the next activity in the series (e.g. if you skip to activity R, when you finish it, FCC will automatically take you to activity S)"

These challenges are too easy and thing’s I’ve already covered in my career. Is there a way to skip ahead to more advanced challenges.
5593996715522ed4b3e32699	FreeCodeCamp/SaltLakeCity	2016-07-07T21:25:05.029Z	550a359115522ed4b3dd7a98	metasean	577ec8b17aeb080527740422	@trevlar - I'm not sure how active they are on Facebook, but the study group and FCC groups both have decent turnouts most Saturdays.   I'm probably not going to make it this Saturday, but I'm sure we'll meet one of these Saturdays.  Until then, keep codin' :wink: 
5593996715522ed4b3e32699	FreeCodeCamp/SaltLakeCity	2016-07-07T21:21:27.604Z	55cd59550fc9f982bead5684	trevlar	577ec7d77aeb08052773f518	@metasean Thanks for the information. I’ve joined the Facebook group though I didn’t receive as detailed of an answer. I appreciate it.

I'm an odd man out, because I refuse to Facebook.  That said, I've run a similar group via Meetup.com for a couple of years now.  

Brian Barrow, who is the leader and POC for the Salt Lake FreeCodeCamp chapter and I are cross-posting meetings.  So if you don't do Facebook, you can find them easily here - http://www.meetup.com/UtahJS/events/231326018/ or you can join the Facebook group (hopefully this link will get you in the right area - https://www.facebook.com/events/570910843096824/)

All that said, the study groups I run are the first saturday each month, and Brian tends to schedule 2 FCC meetups each month, so you should be able to meet with other FCC folks at least 3 weekends a month. "

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

To give brownie points you send a message in the format `thanks @yourname`.

I'm new here and looking forward to  coding with y'all in the future. I do have a question. It doesn't seem like this room is super-busy. Is there a more lively room that usually has people talking in it throughout the day that anyone can recommend? Specifically, if I need help or something?

In particular,  we have a study group that meets the first Saturday each month.  The group decides what we focus on each month.  Our September study group is still limited to 15 people, but starting in October we're moving to a larger venue, so –if there's enough interest– we could easily have a FCC group.
p.s. I'm not sure why gitter is showing a past meetup as the next meetup and I can't edit it to fix it."

If you want to build a map project, I'd suggest you start with https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page, http://leafletjs.com/index.html, and https://github.com/jseppi/Leaflet.MakiMarkers (they've been easy enough that I haven't actually had to tap into the community).  If you want to build a data visualization project, I'd suggest you start with http://d3js.org/   and definitely try to make it to HackNightSLC this Thursday.  Some of the competition organizers should be there, and there will be other programmers that might be able to assist you.  If you go down the D3 route, you can reach out to http://www.meetup.com/Utah-d3-js/ for possible assistance.

Please, don't let your novice status stop you!!!   There are a few teams at this point, but we'd love to see some more, and a project made by a  team of novices would rock!  ;-)

I try to have hands-on activities for those meetings, but our July 21st meetup will actually be a presentation (about an organization teaching kids JS through game development).  Please say 'hi' if you make it to one of our meetups! :smile:   Also, if you haven't already, I'd strongly encourage you to attend the [UtahJS Conference](http://conf.utahjs.com/) [3] on Sep 25th.
