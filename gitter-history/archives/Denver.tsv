We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

Captain Kidd may have also had some involvement. They gave up piracy for booty alone and attacked slave ships to set the slaves free. Their community didn't allow any money or leaders and lived peacefully until raising the envy of others.

Took an intro class in C and did some work on the HTML/CSS and Python courses with Codecademy before I found out about FCC

I haven't gone very far through the FCC curriculum yet.  I'm also not a web developer.  I'm an SDE, so I'm not doing the type of work exactly that FCC is geared toward.
