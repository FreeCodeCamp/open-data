We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

The part that made me absolutely crazy  was getting the text  for the tweet box, then getting the text to change.  I probably looked at 50 sites at least.  One problem had been that my button was outside of my link, instead of the reverse.  Then there's the using twitter-share-button versus twitter.com/intent/tweet.

I let the whole thing sit on the back burner in my mind, then decided I certainly knew how to do the html portion.  From there, I just soldiered on, looking at tons of question/answer sites.    I'm hoping to finish the second zipline today.  Where are you at in the course?

That took me days, but I learned (and forgot) a lot.  I'm sure my code is very sloppy.    Take a look:  http://codepen.io/VWinter/full/WvqLNv/
