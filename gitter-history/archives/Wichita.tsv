Tried 4-5 different solutions. If anything, it helped me tie all that I learned together. I think I'm beginning to understand JavaScript logic, better! Yay! :D"

Don't know what it means to ""test myObj for checkProp"" because checkProp isn't even in the myObj variable...... or maybe I'm just understanding this wrong. :S"

Just starting to get the hang of using the chat function. I keep on using the Wiki section where there often is the ""answer key."" From there, I reverse-engineer it to figure it out, or I glance at it to help me, but even still, I don't fully understand the logic behind it....or if I have questions, it doesn't really help me. So I guess I better start using the chat function! :P"
