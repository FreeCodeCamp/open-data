I was skeptical but have accumulated a couple hundred bucks passively now. https://digit.co/r/wGTdv?wn (Yes that's a referral link. That's not why I brought it up though, I really do like it and use it).

I just started using it and it does what it says. Only thing is there is a 3 day holding period on your cash once you sell a stock so you can't really day-trade too much unless you have a sizeable cash balance.

Since 2011 though, I have seen ~4% annualized returns (~8% time-weighted) after fees. For comparison, Vanguard's 2050 Target Retirement fund with a similar allocation had an annualized return of 4.5% over the past 3 years, so it seems reasonable.

I like it. The fees are slightly higher than what you'd pay at Vanguard, but it's very simple and has no minimum investment amount. There are a couple of other perks like automated rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, though I think competing services also have these features or will soon.

A great book that's a short read is If You Can: How Millennials Can Get Rich Slowly by William J Bernstein. It will take you just a few hours to get through (and you can find a free and legal pdf of it with a quick google) and is a great primer to saving/finance/investing. The title is a bit misleading since it's applicable to all generations, not just millenials. As you read through it, there are several great books that he mentions and if you work your way through all of them you'll be at a great spot for thinking about managing your own finances. Another good way to get up to speed is to go through posts on reddit.com/r/personalfinance. @CodeNonprofit mentioned earlier The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham. It's a great book and a must-read if you want to get into the value investing space, but I would hesitate recommending it as one of your first books in finance since it's pretty dense and a big time commitment. Hope that helps!

I started trading options when I was 16, went to school and got degrees in Finance and Applied Math, worked as a professional market maker for the options on the S&P 500 (SPX) in both the Chicago pits and electronically, then realized the lifestyle of a software developer suits me much better. I am still actively trading my own account and enjoy helping people demystify the world of options and investing. Feel free to ask me any questions and I'm more than happy to suggest some free resources to get you started

I had to make the decision 2 years ago to attend a community college vs take on mountains of debt...although I knew the benefits and was financially more aware than most people my age ..... I do get flack from my peers who went to universities. Luckily I think the annoyance of people belittling my education is greatly outweighed by the benefits - I Plan on transferring next fall - and I would make the same decision if I could go back

If I were to give specific advice to my 18 year old self who just graduated it would be go to community college and get an Associates in a STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering or Math — and maintain a decent GPA so I can transfer to a university) Then finish the last 2 years at the university. Maintain a network of friends at the schools to keep in touch with. Work on tons of side projects and create a really good resume highlighting all of my real skills, interests, experience. Basically, just dont get into too much debt and do the bare minimum  when it comes to school. Be a cool person who is always working on things and keep in touch with people.

I wish I could do it full time but have two kids so can only work it part time because I have to work.

Do I recommend a degree — yes. Do I think it’s worth the *debt* - no. If you can pay your way through it, do it. Because there are still too many jobs out there that wont consider you without a degree. My job is one of them.
55ab70f637f2ad22587e6205	FreeCodeCamp/Saving	2015-07-24T15:56:10.191Z	5587965b15522ed4b3e25670	itzsaga	55b2601abab860d81689dd6b	Well after your first job nobody cares about where you got your degree. They're looking at your past work. So state school vs. private college is usually not worth the price difference.

However, I think there is a part of life that happens in college that you might not get elsewhere.

I started off learning about money by selling my old stuff on eBay and that gradually changed to learning to buy and sell stuff online in general, which led to buying my first warehouse (it was a shed really), and I converted it into a shared office, from there it was housing / real estate.

Be careful if you go to college at all. Most of my friends with degrees have low paying jobs. All of them that have STEM degrees do have good jobs though.

Although the ROI is higher, the time and energy put into constantly dealing with issues  is not worth it for me. I would rather rent out a home that’s in good condition to the right people, and enjoy a smaller cashflow.

Usually little things: AC not turning on, toilet issues. I subscribe to an annual maintenance plan for those things so they just take care of it for the most part. The last time I had to spend significant money was when a backyard fence fell over. That could have been avoided if I checked the fence before buying the home, it was something that neither I nor the inspector noticed.

My buying and renting strategy is very specific — I acquire properties that will require little maintenance (or I fix them up to require less maintenance, e.g., put in non-carpet flooring) and I screen my tenants appropriately.

If you can afford a significant down payment and repair/maintenance costs, you can expect to make  greater than 10% annual return on your money. What’s great about real estate investing is that the longer you are in the game, the more leverage you have for future investments which require less cash out of pocket."

I personally prefer purchasing index funds myself and stay away from allowing others to manage my money. I'm no CFP but I feel that in the long haul the market makes money.

Call it fun money - The issue is and the thing many don't realize is, investing is and prbably should be very 'boring'. You shouldnt be required to check your holding every week and you should probably set things up so money is automatically distributed amongst your accounts... Just my two cents. Finance Major - Really interested in exploring fee-only financial planning / become a CFP -  Its really great to know that if / when I have a business Idea I want to run with ... i'll have a finance background along with a newly acquired and continually progressing - web development technical background.

I strongly believe that outside of investing for fun, like buying a share of Tesla just to see how it goes or whatever, the best option for the majority of people is to invest in a low cost index fund.
