5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:24:42.761Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	57115c1a548df1be102d5ce1	Got to find dinner/study algorithms. Was nice chatting with you, too! And you as well.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:24:24.404Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	57115c085ed5a4fd3fe37576	Okay. I may be. If not I'll be around tomorrow at some point. It was nice chatting with you, have a good evening :)
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:23:46.239Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	57115be22c97111664325d1f	I guess I better go for now. I'll probably be back later, though.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:23:05.300Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	57115bb92c97111664325d09	Yeah, I really like the navigation and the links down in the footer
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:22:14.910Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	57115b865cd40114649bbbfe	That sucks... especially with such an awesome page fronting it.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:21:52.307Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	57115b702c97111664325cfd	Oh he loved it. He designed it. The company just flopped harder than the Green Lantern movie...
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:21:12.931Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	57115b483ddb73ba105c8990	"The guy on the left in the picture is the designer. The one on the right is his stoner buddy out in Cali that was trying to help promote it, who ended up turning the whole thing into something about weed. So I'm the guy who doesn't do drugs developing this site telling them, ""You guys need to chill out with all the weed stuff in your videos or you're not going to do any business..."" Lo and behold, they sold one shirt to the stoner guy's mom lol"
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:19:59.642Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	57115affaf4636103864fe2c	Yeah. You've got it anchored. And I'm surprised he didn't like this. Where do you get your images from, by the way?
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:18:16.742Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	57115a984c2125fc3f02d41b	It's a one pager, but it should have been effective. Like I said, he's stubborn as hell though. He was trying to sell the shirts for way too much and I despise some of the copy on there.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:17:09.210Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	57115a552c97111664325cb1	Oh man. It looks great!
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:16:44.889Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	57115a3c2c97111664325ca4	http://stayhighlypositive.com/ is the failed company site I did
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:16:38.165Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	57115a36af4636103864fe00	Interesting. That is a weird connection, then. Maybe the guy just knew he went over there quite a bit or something.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:14:18.943Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	571159aab30cfa0f384bdd8d	He went into my old job on a somewhat regular basis, but it was usually to see when I was getting off or come visit me
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:14:01.531Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	57115999af4636103864fdd9	I'm not sure if they're too effective. You can't put too much on one page. Or you'd have to anchor it so that people get to the right part of the page when they click on a menu item.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:13:06.642Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571159622c97111664325c61	You mentioned where you worked. I just figured the guy might have worked there, too. Did he not?
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:11:44.544Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	571159104c2125fc3f02d3b1	It was a one-pager. This guy was obsessed with them. I hate them. They're tedius. Effective, but tedius.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:11:13.260Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	571158f13ddb73ba105c88de	No, he knew an old friend of mine that moved to Australia a few weeks ago. I feel like it was super random that he brought that up lol. Maybe he's met me in passing before and recognized the name or the picture?
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:10:50.859Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571158da5cd40114649bbb46	Wow. That's crazy. You can do some pretty fast work, then.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:10:12.037Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	571158b4b30cfa0f384bdd3b	The site that's down, I finished in one night after pool league. They called him up and told him they didn't like the design and wanted a redesign, so he calls me as soon as I pull up to Baileys to tell me. So I tell him to start working on the design and call me when he has something to send my way... I didn't get anything from him until 2:45 in the morning and I had it finished by 10am.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:09:40.619Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571158945ed5a4fd3fe37491	So the other guy who was in this chat knew that guy?
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:09:40.348Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	57115894548df1be102d5be2	The one who didn't pay you?
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:09:16.611Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	5711587c5ed5a4fd3fe3748a	And having the code might be able to help you get a job, too.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:08:45.143Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	5711585d2c97111664325c10	Okay... that's good. 
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:08:24.734Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	571158485ed5a4fd3fe3747a	Yeah, it's all still here. I'm saving it for when I have the money to get him to court.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:07:57.255Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	5711582d548df1be102d5bb8	Well you know you don't need the stuff live, right? If you know you worked on it, I'd be snatching up the code and keeping it on your computer.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:07:56.138Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	5711582c4c2125fc3f02d36d	One of the things the guy took out of my code was my viewport meta tags, which completely ruined any responsiveness to the sites... He's not a coder and should have never messed with the meta information.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:06:59.157Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	571157f35cd40114649bbb0f	Kind of. One of the healthcare sites is down for whatever reason. Not sure what happened there and I had no contact with them. The other one is slightly changed. He moved some things around and altered my code a little bit when I threatened to sue him for not paying me. I'm wanting to redesign the hair stylist site and optimize the imagery on it.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:06:24.593Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571157d05cd40114649bbb01	Yeah. I went to a hackathon a couple of weekends ago and a guy there told me if you put a link to your github on your resume and there's actually stuff there, it's super helpful.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:05:12.584Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	57115788af4636103864fd40	That's awesome. So you've definitely got some stuff you can showcase.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:04:31.060Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	5711575f5cd40114649bbadd	I've heard of it, never looked into it though.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:03:56.567Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	5711573c2c97111664325bba	I did a site for my friend who wrote a book back around like 2010 or so that's changed since my version, have been discussing helping my friend out in California redesign her site, did 2 healthcare company sites with my old designer I mentioned earlier as well as a site for the company he tried to launch (and failed because he's stubborn as rocks), and one for my friend who's a hair stylist
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:02:36.564Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571156ecaf4636103864fd0a	But yeah... you should try out heroku if you never have. It's pretty nice.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:02:14.324Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571156d64c2125fc3f02d306	Otherwise, I could use apache to run backend stuff on my machine.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:01:56.668Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571156c4b30cfa0f384bdca0	That could. I've been using Heroku, though. There's an option where you can just run your stuff locally with the command - heroku local web
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:00:52.319Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	571156845ed5a4fd3fe373f2	Yeah. I like CP way better than JSFiddle though. I think there's a PHP version of JSFiddle if that helps?
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:00:42.265Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	5711567a5ed5a4fd3fe373ef	So what kinds of work have you done thus far?
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T21:00:14.952Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	5711565e3ddb73ba105c8811	Yep. Like jsfiddle, it's only meant for front end, I guess.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:59:24.331Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	5711562c2c97111664325b67	Ah, CodePen isn't great for backend work lol
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:58:43.079Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	57115603548df1be102d5b0a	True. I could do that. I may a bit later on. I did have it set up, though, where I was delivering the pages through routes on the backend.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:57:34.903Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	571155be4c2125fc3f02d2ac	You could always try to replicate it on CodePen
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:57:16.350Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571155ac548df1be102d5ae7	And maybe building something that actually makes good use of an API would be better... or builds one. I have to do that next week for my cloud/mobile dev class.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:56:32.887Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571155805cd40114649bba42	Yeah. It took a bit :( I guess I can only get better at building stuff like that, though.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:56:04.942Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	57115564af4636103864fc84	That probably took a while, yeah?
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:55:31.643Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571155435ed5a4fd3fe3738e	It was a how-to guide on how to use The Movie Database API. And I used Bootstrap for the first time to put it together.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:54:36.971Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	5711550caf4636103864fc6a	?
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:54:34.917Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	5711550b4c2125fc3f02d277	Ouch! What was it
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:54:14.662Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571154f6b30cfa0f384bdc18	And I found out earlier today I accidentally deleted one good thing I had when I removed my Amazon Web Services account.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:53:20.770Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571154c05cd40114649bba0a	All I have is schoolwork thus far.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:52:37.248Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571154955ed5a4fd3fe37353	Nothing yet. That's one reason I'm interested in FreeCodeCamp. I need some kind of portfolio to show what I can do.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:50:49.969Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	571154293ddb73ba105c8744	Lisa, do you have any freelance projects you've done?
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:50:22.867Z	56eeb1e185d51f252ab9ce3f	MarkBLittle	5711540e5cd40114649bb9d1	Yeah man, definitely. I may be on later, I'm not sure yet.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:49:36.788Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571153e0b30cfa0f384bdbd2	Nice to meet you, too. And same! I'm free most of the time, like I said.
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:49:19.892Z	56f160af85d51f252aba2ee3	whieronymus	571153cf548df1be102d5a5c	ALright guys. I'm done for the day at the office. I'll probably be on later tonight though. It was nice to meet yall. Let me know when you want to do a meet up!
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:49:07.525Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571153c35cd40114649bb9ba	I'll have to look into that when we go back over there again.

On Mondays, if you spend $15 or more (which isn't hard to do...) you get free pool. I'm not sure if Ballantyne does that too, but Pineville does.

So the $8-10 an hour they charge depending on the day could be free or $8 for the whole night depending on if you play a match that night.

That experience helped me grow, but when you're working with somebody who is such a stickler for orphans/widows in text in a responsive site it gets tedious and annoying. You're going to have some orphans and widows in web lol
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:02:08.726Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571148c02c9711166432575b	Ugh... that really sucks. So you're in south Charlotte, too? I've been wondering if there were more down here. I want to go to Amelie's, but I don't know if I can get motivated enough to get up there by 9 on a Saturday.

5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T20:00:17.998Z	570b0c8a187bb6f0eaded0fd	lisabscheibner	571148525cd40114649bb654	But even with the expansion/time around, I guess Skookum and AvidXChange could still both be considered startups.

There's a company my buddy used to work for called E-Dreamz that he really loved working for. He was more of a designer but I think he was doing FE dev
5593932315522ed4b3e3253d	FreeCodeCamp/Charlotte	2016-04-15T19:58:41.222Z	56f160af85d51f252aba2ee3	whieronymus	571147f14c2125fc3f02ce9c	WebDev is more of a freelance/start up route I've noticed. Most enterprise size companies use .NET or Java

I would argue against it, but he's definitely in demand. I figured there would be some web dev stuff open, too, though. That's really what I want to do.

The Belk office has some front end stuff, and there's a few smaller companies, but being a banking city, most of the big companies where the money's really at want .NET around here.

I joined a Slack group called DevChat that has a FreeCodeCamp  channel . I primarily code in python and haven't made it too far down the FreeCodeCamp path yet.

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

Self taught across a few languages throughout a digital marketing career, but never built anything completely on my own. Pretty good experience with MySQL on the data extraction and analysis side, and know the basics across HTML, CSS and Javascript. Really looking to get my hands dirty, so FCC seems like a great resource for that

I started on free code camp a few days ago, and I'll be starting on the bonfires tomorrow if anyone is interested in working together.

So, I don't know many people in my field here, or my way around uptown :smile:

They have actually changed a lot since i started about a month ago. The html/css, and bootstrap sections are all new. They replaced the codecademy work they had there, i had to redo that. They also got rid of the basic computer science section and dev tools that was before javascript. That took about a week for me to get through. Actually they are supposed to be pushing out some changes sometime this week replacing the jquery section with some custom stuff they have built. also going to be rearranging the order that you do things. Moving the easier ziplines to after the basic javascript.

It was always a better use of my time to google what I was trying to accomplish with JS and I'd always find someone that had addressed it. I could modify it to meet my needs, but staring at a blank page trying to come up with my own JS is kicking me in the balls.
