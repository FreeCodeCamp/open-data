We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

First thing everyone runs to over here is the liquor store, just in case....lol

5593985b15522ed4b3e32655	FreeCodeCamp/Orlando	2015-08-21T11:08:10.732Z	55d38a8f0fc9f982beadd12a	codeonthecob	55d7069a098731da7020b4c7	@mwiegman It was not horrible, however it may have changed recently. There was no min GPA but said it was competitive. The only other main admission requirement is that you have college algebra or better.  Ive read on message boards recently that they are getting a lot more applicants and are turning them away now. So I can't say for sure if that is true, but it's a sweet setup so I'd imagine so! I can walk you through the process or answer any questions tnat you need!

5593985b15522ed4b3e32655	FreeCodeCamp/Orlando	2015-08-20T04:15:03.963Z	55d38a8f0fc9f982beadd12a	codeonthecob	55d55447a92a8b4b219b0641	@mwiegman Yes I want some practical experience under my belt. I have this term off (4 months) so I can use that to work on coding skills and practicing for interviews! I am excited, this seems like a wonderful group and community!
5593985b15522ed4b3e32655	FreeCodeCamp/Orlando	2015-08-20T04:13:54.709Z	55d38a8f0fc9f982beadd12a	codeonthecob	55d55402a231f3815231de90	@mwiegman  I am doing the post bach program, my goal is about a year and a half total. It is pretty good. Each person will certainly have a different experience since it is distance learning. For the most part, you are on your own and must have self discipline. The classes are not easy at all, very very challenging. Since it is accelerated they start you off fast and tough. Without any classroom time it does make it a little harder to grasp concepts so quickly. I am grateful for the program, but without a doubt it is much tougher than my first degree!
5593985b15522ed4b3e32655	FreeCodeCamp/Orlando	2015-08-19T23:53:23.881Z	55c81d350fc9f982beaccf28	mwiegman	55d516f311c7afc249786854	@codeonthecob Welcome! I'm pretty new to FCC too.  How do you like the CS program at Oregon State? Are you doing the accelerated online program? I had looked into that program a few months ago but it was more than I could afford at the time. So I guess you will be using FCC for extra coding practice while you get your degree?
5593985b15522ed4b3e32655	FreeCodeCamp/Orlando	2015-08-19T01:03:34.682Z	55d38a8f0fc9f982beadd12a	codeonthecob	55d3d5e69c0eaccb36ae2fec	I am currently enrolled at Oregon State for CS. I have a previous degree in Polysci. I do have some basic skills. I've built webpages, played with flash, php. Also a couple terms of basic c++. So learning but also building on skills!

Still, it will be very helpful to have just completed the courses when you reach the bonfires.  The bonfires are a great test of javascript skills.  I learned a lot.

It's free and open source.  I've used it many times for personal projects; though I've never needed much out of it, so I'm not sure how it would compare to Illustrator.

Still, SVG is essentially code (XML, which is not very dissimilar from HTML).  You can do a lot with just a text editor.  You can even [style it with CSS](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/styling-and-animating-svgs-with-css/)."

I don't have Illustrator though. I can only afford Photoshop or Illustrator and I use Photoshop more. :/

I've been trying to work on this with a full time job and family, too.  It's tough, but I've learned a lot.  I'm sure your animation background could be quite useful; have you ever looked into [animated SVG](http://davidwalsh.name/svg-animation)?
