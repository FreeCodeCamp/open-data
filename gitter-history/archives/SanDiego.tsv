I just wanted to put an awesome upcoming event on your radars - **RailsBridge**: https://www.bridgetroll.org/events/247
This 2-day event aims to empower and encourage women to code.
On the back-end, you will learn **Ruby** and **Rails**.
On the front-end, you will learn **JavaScript**

Their curriculum: http://docs.railsbridge.org/docs/

You will also get to build applications, like a Job Board, a Message Board, a JavaScript Browser Game, a JavaScript To Do List with **REACT**!!!
If you’re of the female persuasion, I highly encourage you to attend.

**THIS EVENT IS NOT LIMITED TO WOMEN ONLY**
If you’re male and are interested in attending, you have 2 options:
1. You may attend as a Student if you’re accompanied by a female student.
2. You may attend as a Volunteer.
I will be volunteering as a Teacher Assistant (TA).
I encourage everyone to attend as this is a great learning opportunity, and you get to build up your portfolio!!"

We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.

Although you must know that simply following this course will not get you all the way - there will be times when you have to use outside resources. What I suggest is follow free codecamps curriculum because the order in which they present new technologies is ideal. Its just you shouldnt rely on free codecamp to get you 100% of the way to becoming a proficient, employed full time web developer.

I am very good with picking up new #technolgiies, website concepts, and even programming concepts, however I just wanted to make sure that this course due to it’s length (Which Seems To Be A Good Thing) will be beneficial to me in developing new programs, websites, and other projects in the #future.

I haven’t really done serious programming since High School (Back When I Used Basic Doing Line By Line - I Know This Ages Me). I am doing lessons at least a few times a week, although I wish I could accomplish lessons after, I do have to work which makes my time a little bit more limited. I am finding the #courses to be easy to fllow and I am learning a lot. I am glad to meet all of you and the #community #based #features will come in very handy when I run into some problems that I just can’t figure out (Keeping Fingers Crosed As So Far I Have Been Able To Figure Out The Lessons). I have completed several sections so far and I am looking forward to becoming proficeint with all of the concepts I am learning as I am sure it will help me. I really enjoy #code #development, #webiste #design, and #development, and look forward to creating my own #mobile #applications as well. It is nice to meet you all and I hope to get to know a few of you in the #San #Diego area. - Have A Great Weekend And Good Luck On Your Courses.

1. In the top left corner there's an errant ""http"".
2. The alarm didn't go off! (I had volume at 100%.)
2. For the top buttons I only see an orange line. Did you mean for there not to be text? (Although discovering the stopwatch was like uncovering a secret level.) Oh nevermind - I see the text when I ctrl+- to minimize.
3. Relatedly, the height is larger than my browser screen (extra height ~= about the height of my extra toolbars, maybe any viewport height calculations don't account for that?). So I have to scroll down to press start. (And even if I'm scrolled to the top I still don't see the text on the buttons).
4. Backspace and arrow keys don't work when entering a time. Delete does.
5. When I type over a previously entered number, the cursor skips to the end after entering the first digit. (E.g., if I'd already entered ""11"" and tried to instead enter ""55"", the cursor would skip to the end after typing a single a ""5"" and the second ""5"" doesn't register.)

Thanks for posting this; I like the lap feature and the animations were really fun to watch. It's cool to see what other people can do."

5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-26T18:00:22.199Z	558648d915522ed4b3e23905	MirPresT	55ddfeb668a150880e9117ef	"Yea I think  you told me about it and i said to myself psh. ""Ill just do it myself. lol"" whats it called?"

5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-26T17:54:47.701Z	558648d915522ed4b3e23905	MirPresT	55ddfd679f8795cd3e1fb970	@rcdavis4  I just didnt know it was needed for those specific properties... I knew I needed it for things like animations etc.

I was wondering why safari was totally wrecking my projects. The following properties require vendor prefixes for proper support: Transform, Transform-origin, and Transition. I use all three of these a lot and had no idea . just thought I'd share. ( varies across versions  of course )

@young92117  absolutely . It will help though just to start coding your own page, no matter what you end up making. its good practice. Create a file titled index.html and then click ctr+O and you can select your file and view it in your browser. That shortcut is the letter O and works on chrome. not sure what the shortcut is on other browsers. Then connect a css file to your html page and just play around . "

5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-26T02:57:49.737Z	55c5a5a40fc9f982beaca8cd	young92117	55dd2b2d04a673003162b6e0	@MirPresT That is good strategy. I will definitely try it. Before FCC changes, I finished all HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, Javascript waypoint and was in the middle of algorithm bonfires..

@young92117  I would start with creating a basic site that just had a home page about page and contact page. I would structure the pages into long rectangles and devide the contact as such. Don't worry about functionality right away and just start with practicing html and css. Linking one page to another I believe is a good start. Add some images, have fun with it. How far are you in FCC's curriculum?"

If all my issue is just the matter of coming up with my own design, I should not have issue with recreating someone else’s design with my knowledge of HTML and CSS.   However, that is not the case for me. I have equally hard time to recreate (or at lease, understnading the basic skeleton ) other’s web pages. 
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-26T00:41:17.869Z	55c5a5a40fc9f982beaca8cd	young92117	55dd0b2dfcfd5a7865af6110	I feel like there was some gap in my understanding of HTML and CSS and applying those to create and/or reverse engineer the web pages.

I mean coming up with my own design is of course hard. But, I don’t even have slightest idea on how other web pages are constructed when I looked at those.

Note why they look good and model some of the ideas you like. Also a big thing that can make a project look nice is an appropriate color scheme...color hunt or coolors.co are great resources for color combinations. As @rcdavis mentioned as well, sketching also can help a ton.

I just can't seem to make things pretty enough without some strange side effect or wrapping, or overwriting of previous CSS.

I somehow lost the momentum ever since the site update. I wasn't able to login for couple of days during and after site remodeling.

Would it be a bad thing to put groups together  of similar experience? Or do you think things should be mixed ?

I can set up a skeleton project and everyone can start from there.  The project with have some basic user stories that everyone can contribute to, and then a few advanced stories for groups with people that are further along with js and would like a bit more of a challenge.  Similar to the SD Ruby magic night.  Any thoughts?

I need to scroll it to put it in the center.  Other than that, it looks good to me.

You don't have to spend much time on it but check it out - [here](http://codepen.io/MirPresT/full/oXJOqW)

Regret not talking with you more. Thank you and @MirPresT for the help.  @therahl Thank you so much for setting this up and moderating.  Sorry I didn't get to talk more, was a bit intimidated working with knowledgable people. I speak only for myself, but like the idea of smaller groups. Like two or three max.  i get flustered and self-conscious too easily. Are you guys going to js/python meetup saturday?

The cool thing is, usually no new 'coding' concepts are introduced in them, its just a matter of setting everything up to work ... so regardless of time, you know you will always get it setup eventually..

First, everyone is cordially invited! Second, if you come, please feel free (and it is encouraged) to bring your laptop and some problme or project you are working on. There will be no scheduled talks or specific agenda. You can bring any code/project to work on/seek help on/or just show up and hangout and enjoy the vibe. If you are having any problems with Bonfires or Ziplines or are just working on your own code, by all means come on out. Here is the meetup link and please RSVP if you think you are going to come. I will be there and I know a number of other FCC/SD regulars will be in attendance, as well as some lukers and others. We might even get a few special guest experts from the local SD JS community (I know of at least 2 who will be ther, possibly more.) Finally, if that’ not enough to get you to come out, we are colatcating with the Python Workshop and they have some VERY interesting people, including some bioinformatacists, some data scientists, and some computational neurobiologists. I know I tend to be long-written, so I’ll stop now and throw out the link: http://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-JavaScript-Study-Group/events/224352548/

I've taken a data structures class where we touched on sorting algorithms and really didn't enjoy them...

But its a pretty cool way to meet people in industry in SD. Anyways, i should probably get back to what I was working on. nice ' chat' meeting you @trevormcgrath

I was myself when I first went, I suspect it’s the same with most of us. Try to make the one on the 11th., the more folks we have with varying and different backgrounds and skillsets, the better for all of us. Look forward to meeting you soon. That’s basicallly the inaugural one, so you’ll probably not be the only person who doesn’t know anyone.

5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-04T17:09:46.737Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55c0f1daeff8f1d77cc3269a	@trevormcgrath sounds cool! as Terrell said, we have met up and plan on meeting up in the future. There is an FCC/SD meetup on August 11th. in fact, and several non FCC meetups some of us tend to go to as well.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-04T17:07:07.633Z	558648d915522ed4b3e23905	MirPresT	55c0f13b9fb911ea312a0dfc	Absolutely - Also. there are some pretty cool meetups happening every month and all SD Free Code Campers are invited - we usually post info about them in the facebook group or post a message in the chat room. Congrats on the front end intern position.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-04T17:05:01.552Z	55bfab2a0fc9f982beac07e0	trevormcgrath	55c0f0bdeff8f1d77cc32659	@Joe-Balsamo @MirPresT Awesome, thanks guys. Seems like we're all kind of in the same boat. I'm currently interning for a start up doing front end/UI stuff for them. Looking to make the transition into a full time front end role hopefully in the near future. Looking forward to working with and possibly meeting you all
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-04T17:02:27.002Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55c0f0232c1b3bec31989a81	In any case, welcome to the group and glad to have you here :)

I am reentering the busines/changing careers if you will and while I’m a pretty fair programmer and algo designer, my front end skills are what I need to work on. In any case, very glad to have you in the community to both learn and help out. That’s what makes this place very special and useful, I think.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-04T16:59:12.056Z	55bfab2a0fc9f982beac07e0	trevormcgrath	55c0ef609fb911ea312a0dc5	I guess I'll just do a quick about me – been self teaching web dev stuffs since about January to supplement computer science classes at SDSU (graduated in May). Just discovered FCC and it seems like a great resource, particularly the active community. Yesterday I flew all the way through to the Basic Javascript section (I'm very familiar with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery). Will see how my Javascript skills fair against the Rock Paper Scissors today!

5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-04T16:51:19.569Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55c0ed87eff8f1d77cc325d0	OK, cool, @MirPresT.  @rcdavis4 first, do you understand the problem? Reason I ask is I had a hard time with the wording, and in fact, I think I actually did a bit of “shade tree” test-driven-dev because I just wrote something, made the tests fail, then from that I was able to discern what they were looking for. The description as to what they want in that problem could be more clear. Plus, you have to muck with objects, and I think this is one of the first or first couple of Bonfires that deal with objects, if I’m not mistaken.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-04T16:32:34.174Z	558648d915522ed4b3e23905	MirPresT	55c0e9229fb911ea312a0c6a	@Joe-Balsamo  We decided we would talk today - as sometimes its nice to just take a break. Feel free to chime in with suggestions - 
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-04T12:40:06.980Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55c0b2a62c1b3bec31988ed6	Bottom line, don’t give up! You aren’t necessarily supposed to just “get them” right away. Also, don’t hesitate to ask for pair programming help if you want.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-04T12:38:18.116Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55c0b23aeff8f1d77cc31a8a	@rcdavis4 Cliff, did Terrell get you covered OK with that one? If it’s any consolation, I felt the same way regarding the difficult of the Bonfires, some are harder than others for different people and even though some are all rated with one bonfire, I think some are still harder. They are written by different people, so naturally different people will rate them differently :)
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-04T05:44:53.723Z	558648d915522ed4b3e23905	MirPresT	55c051552c1b3bec319884b7	@rcdavis4  messaged you -

5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-08-01T20:55:00.325Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55bd32248deffbc44d8e1752	I think so, I liked his weather app a lot. I’m actually thinking of making some changes in mine to more model a virtual weather station. I also liked his atttitude. I have, frankly, been kind of rushing thru things, at least the Bonfires, and didn’t spend as much time on the design of the quote app as I would’ve liked. Think I will really do some front end design on the weather app

I'm just going to keep working on the content and work on all the waypoints I still have left. Then if there are things missing , Ill look for other resources to learn them - Not to worried about gulp at the moment ha -

They are giving “lightning” talks usually like 5 or so minutes depending on how many speakers they have. There’s going to be a Google Analytics talk, which I’m especially looking forward to. Feel free to add your own RSVP to the MeetUp site, if you want, it probably helps them gauge the amount of pizza to buy :) http://www.meetup.com/san-diego-code-school/events/223765762/ Just want to add, too, the FreeCodeCamp/San Diego is not affiliated with San Diego Code School, that’s Michael, the organizer’s group. Just since myself and a few others were planning on going to this event anyway, we decided to piggyback off this as a “meet and greet for our group.” Other than that, I’m looking forward to meeting everyone tonight and I think, judging by the number of participants, it’s going to be a pretty big event as these things go.

5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-24T00:33:18.885Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55b187ce5992e2977c41951d	Personally, I go for the less code/reads easier first, then worry about the other stuff later. But you definitely did a fine job, IMHO :)

Don’t do what Donald Knuth calls “premature optimiaztion.” For one thing you really have no way to know which is “best” (fastest, uses less memory/resources, less power) without testing.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-24T00:32:20.195Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55b18794145c42fe657e6e6d	@rcdavis4 Cliff, I’m partial to the last one, probably because that’s similar to what I did. I’d probably do it more functionally, now.

So, yeah, basically, you have to write the function yourself :smile: However, it really shouldn’t be that convoluted.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-23T05:12:08.253Z	558d7be815522ed4b3e2dbd4	rcdavis4	55b077a8145c42fe657e4907	hey all, not sure if anyone is up. i have a question about bonfire #10 'repeat a string', is there a reason not to use the .repeat() method. should we know how to solve this the long form way (i'm not exactly sure which way that is)? some examples i saw on stackoverflow were convoluted and seemingly annoyingly overcomplicated (at least for my tired brain). any thoughts? thanks in advance.

I just finished the last html & css waypoint and have a question (couldn't find an answer in the resources). Are there practice projects built into the waypoints, bonfires, etc. (like ""build a simple, static webpage on your own""), to reinforce learning through repetition and problem solving, or is it up to me to invent those? Or is the practice just built in? Thanks!"
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-21T00:38:04.553Z	558648d915522ed4b3e23905	MirPresT	55ad946c0b0e863a256f54eb	"@Madrona7 Good question - as of right now the curriculum will not require that you use css html or even jquery until you get past the bonfires and all the way to the ziplines. I personally think it's a good idea to create at least one 'side project' so you can practice your css html jquery and javascript skills as you go through the first half of the curriculum. I would suggest uploading the project on github so you can get practice with that as well. 

the reason I started out with 'as of right now' is because there is an update hopefully coming soon that will change the structure of FCC's curriculum. First I believe the zip-lines will be brought much closer to the beginning of the curriculum so that you can practice your skills -  Second, there will be a section on git ( a version control system) so that, again, you can practice your new skills / knowledge. Finally, I believe aspects of the Javascript sections are changing as well. They have been teasing this update for a while and have still not finished it. Hopefully it will come soon but I don't want to get anyones hopes up if it is still more than a week out..which is possible..

back to your question - It would be a good idea to start your own small project - "

The main meeting that is not directly associated with us, but should still be of interest since it’s essentially a beginner’s fullstack development meeting is at 7. I figure we can meet there, enjoy the presentation by Michael of Zeeto, and if we want, we can get together afterward at a local restaurant/bar/coffeeshop and chat a bit more.

You can find the pseudocode for the permutation function on Wikipedia, actually. It is not an easy problem, at least it wasn’t for me.

Apparently (at least i'm pretty sure) that you were only supposed to use it in the end when you added all the indices together.  I thought there was supposed to be more of a meaning to it....

My original plan was for us to meet at Zeeto on the 30th, and perhaps the SD FCC people get together after that at  a local watering hole or restaurant, then @therahl was talking to the people at LEARN to get us a more formal place.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-17T20:23:01.772Z	5598252e15522ed4b3e35e55	yutungh	55a9642510521a7e5255843b	unless you want to meet more in a room type setting with some sort of agenda...either way, not everyone is going to be able to make it so I think probably any sort of weekend date will probably suffice

I spoke with Chelsea and she said Tuesdays will be best.  The san diego JS group hosts a lot of events on Tuesday, but it looks like the second tuesday of each month is conflict free, what do you guys think?

One cool thing about the computer game, that I’ve learned, is no one really cares about your age, looks, etc., it’s just about coding and your performance and passion. Yeah, it’s true. Like most of the world, if you aren’t about 28 years old and from an upper middle class white straight family, you are the “odd man out” but you know what? f*ck that sheet! Alan Turing, the father of us all, was a a gay guy! Grace Hopper was a woman when women were considered only secretaries! The REAL deal in this game doesn’t care about that appearance nonsense. I, myself, am an old Jew. Who cares? You like computers and programming? You are IN!

The facility has desks, chairs, nice couch, and a projector.  Let's decide on a date and I can set it up with the owner! 
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-15T00:55:58.032Z	558648d915522ed4b3e23905	MirPresT	55a5af9e17582ac167f408d8	Sounds good - That is what I figured - @rcdavis4 @Joe-Balsamo

I think if you look at that example in the link to the Global Function Object, it will help you down the right path. It was a bit of a head scratcher for me, too. That example there really helped me out.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-14T23:43:11.944Z	5598252e15522ed4b3e35e55	yutungh	55a59e8fc132f78d06ad361f	@Joe-Balsamo  Thanks Joe, I wasn't really looking for an answer anyways xD
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-14T23:37:17.792Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55a59d2df2f123ed05c6c883	@yutungh it is a bit of a tricky one. Probably the toughest of the Basic Algorithm Challenges. First of all, make sure you understand the arguments pseudo-array (my term, since arguments basically only can return arguments.length or arguments[x]. I’m assuming you understand that since it is requred to solved the previous algorithm challenges. Next, really study the MDN examples on the Global Function Object. There is an example in there which is similar to the answer to this problem (though not exact.) Work with that, and if you need additional help, I can provide it, but I don’t want to give away the answer straight away!
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-14T23:24:15.788Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55a59a1ff2f123ed05c6c841	@MirPresT @rcdavis4 yeah, I was just suggesting it as an interim option for those of us in FCC to perhaps use it as a meet up. The Zeeto meet up is also devoted to beginning full stack coders, so I thought that it would both be interesting and useful, and also a place to kind of use as a “meet and greet” for those of us in FCC. Perhaps, afterwards, we could gather at a local watering hole and discuss things further? I’m absolutely committed to an FCC specific thing, I just thought that, rolling off @rcdavis4 suggestion that it might be interesting to meet there.

Are we going to just attend thisone instead of setting something up specific for FCC?

I’m thinking it might be a good place for all of us here to meet, especially since the MeetUp itself is oriented to learning full stack development.

It helps to look at the First set of bonfires as practice rather than a quiz... You will find a few that use regex in which you will be forced to learn more about how they work... its all about trial and error. It is not easy to sit down once and grasp it completely. Just keep working with it and you will get better. Dont worry about being an expert before you ever have to use it .... 
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-08T23:48:53.365Z	558d7be815522ed4b3e2dbd4	rcdavis4	559db6e552cc8c664f513722	haha, right now they are just frustrating. will dive into them further. thanks!

5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-07T03:38:38.147Z	558648d915522ed4b3e23905	MirPresT	559b49bee9c8fd6779dc4e56	Yea but it certainly made more sense when I was able to see what exactly we were recording. I believe I implemented it correctly. It took some time to get it working with my app because I had to make sure it knew when to use the prediction and when to use a random. I also had to make sure when it had a prediction it displayed the right image and recorded the stats correctly as well. If anyone has questions on how to impliment it I'd be happy to explain -

While it’s arguable that it might be helpful at any point, there is no doubt that the benefits of meeting will probably come as we are all more into actually doing projects.

Please post a meeting spot on here so I will know and can stop by.

I've finished it but the cool thing is ... as I learn new ideas such as Angular JS, I can go back and re format my app to include those new ideas. Give great practice and takes your learning to a new level.

5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-04T18:01:15.491Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55981f6ba41cae0c73d57677	Those array methods are functional programming in JS. There are advanced libraries, but again, its more for “down the road”.

5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-04T18:00:40.689Z	558648d915522ed4b3e23905	MirPresT	55981f48e2ac269a32a05e53	@rcdavis4  I don't have any prior experience either so it certainly isnt easy... there are many times I have to just walk away from the computer and start again the next day or later.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-04T18:00:02.735Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55981f226505c69020c0c53c	I recommend not worrying to awfully much about not getting everything on functional programming. It’s definitely worth learning, but TBH with you, there are a LOT of professional programmers that don’t know functional programming
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-04T17:59:28.024Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55981f00a41cae0c73d57673	So that should be good.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-04T17:59:24.872Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55981efc6505c69020c0c538	In fact, at the summit, they said they are adding more jquery stuff, according to Quincy. 
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-04T17:52:03.777Z	558d7be815522ed4b3e2dbd4	rcdavis4	55981d43a6c8169b5632c3ef	Oh okay. Thanks for the update. So I'm worried about the functional programming. Also, are there points in the curriculum to revisit html/css stuff. Felt like I didn't get enough practice to get a good handle on it...also jquery stuff. Or is it something they give a brief overview then on your own to make things and practice with it?
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-04T17:51:08.466Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55981d0ca6c8169b5632c3e6	My prior experience has definitely helped me

I have done a bit of Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but everyone who’s gone on to the MEAN stack tells me I’m really going to like it a lot.
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-04T17:42:12.848Z	558648d915522ed4b3e23905	MirPresT	55981af4a6c8169b5632c3b2	I feel like learning angular, mongo db, node.js, and express js is where the magic happens. Sadly there is so little in Freecodecamp about those ideas..You sort of have to use your own resources to piece the concepts together. 
5593998315522ed4b3e326a0	FreeCodeCamp/SanDiego	2015-07-04T17:41:42.335Z	55863be415522ed4b3e237f5	Joe-Balsamo	55981ad6a41cae0c73d5761a	I haven’t started using Angular yet. Looking forward to it.

I have done it before (functional) so I understood it, but probably not good for someone just doing it.
