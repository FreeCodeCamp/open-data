import React from ""react"";
import { hello } from ""./hello.js"";
var Ctrl = React.createClass ({
    render : function () {
        return (
            <div .... random data ></div>
        );
    }
});
export default Ctrl;
To me, a module is just a file with global code written in it. We reference the module via its filename.

However, I wonder how does this all gel together when we build the production build.

How does the system know that this is a module & not just global varaibles being declared?

Is it the import / export commands that actually make it say: 'aha, this is a module!'"

All I'm trying to do is render ""Hello World"" on the page. What am I doing wrong? I'm guessing it is something to do with the way that I have Codepen set up.

I want to set initial states for them, but some of them will rely on the default state of other to load correctly?

Sorry I can’t be more help.
55c96a410fc9f982beacf1f7	FreeCodeCamp/React	2016-01-26T17:13:34.275Z	55b163f10fc9f982beaac24d	gazzer82	56a7a93e6b6468374a099df9	@ltegman i guess that’s what i’m asking, how to make the getState() function available in the action creator. Do i pass it in via binActionCreators, or do i use redux-thunk to wrap the function and access it that way?
55c96a410fc9f982beacf1f7	FreeCodeCamp/React	2016-01-26T17:02:32.025Z	55863c8015522ed4b3e23814	ltegman	56a7a6a86b6468374a099d49	@gazzer82 You shouldn’t need to. Just make sure that your store’s getState() function is available within the scope of the action creator and use that.
55c96a410fc9f982beacf1f7	FreeCodeCamp/React	2016-01-26T16:46:53.088Z	55b163f10fc9f982beaac24d	gazzer82	56a7a2fd80ad69394a7a904e	"@gazzer82
Morning all.
Question, how would i go about accessing a value on the global redux state in an action creater?
Do i need to use redux-thunk?"
55c96a410fc9f982beacf1f7	FreeCodeCamp/React	2016-01-24T07:42:12.892Z	55b163f10fc9f982beaac24d	gazzer82	56a4805480ad69394a7a20aa	Yeah keeping track of state and props can be nightmare. Redux does make a lot of sense to me once I got my head around it. I've done a reasonable amount of objective c and the messaging system is similar. 
55c96a410fc9f982beacf1f7	FreeCodeCamp/React	2016-01-24T07:38:45.284Z	55863c8015522ed4b3e23814	ltegman	56a47f85aaae7a3a7592c459	I used React without Redux for my Twitch zipline and I think I only had 3 layers of components and I was still getting confused trying to make sure I was passing my state functions through every layer correctly.
55c96a410fc9f982beacf1f7	FreeCodeCamp/React	2016-01-24T07:37:39.472Z	55863c8015522ed4b3e23814	ltegman	56a47f43c54bc2bf180bb17c	Yeah, I think for most of these projects Redux is probably over the top, but at the same time passing all the state management functions around the vanilla React way can get out of hand pretty quick, so I don’t think it’s bad practice to start with Redux and leave room for growth rather than needing to refactor for it when it inevitably gets to unmanagable.
55c96a410fc9f982beacf1f7	FreeCodeCamp/React	2016-01-24T07:32:59.190Z	55b163f10fc9f982beaac24d	gazzer82	56a47e2baaae7a3a7592c44c	Yeah good so far, did a good course on Udemy that took me through the basics of Redux, so I've used Redux for them all, despite it being massive overkill. But at least it makes sense now.

And atleast in the Seattle area I've seen no shortage of job postings asking for React experience (although there are more with Angular asked for).
55c96a410fc9f982beacf1f7	FreeCodeCamp/React	2015-09-30T16:50:54.677Z	5488eea8db8155e6700dded5	aldraco	560c12ee081f3a9c044da688	not a whole lot of React jobs unfortunately, I think that has a lot to do with the decision to focus on angular
55c96a410fc9f982beacf1f7	FreeCodeCamp/React	2015-09-30T16:01:08.185Z	55863c8015522ed4b3e23814	ltegman	560c0744ff22c70f6fab6160	Yeah -- I don't think it helps that the FCC curriculum doesn't even mention React. I sort of wish the front-end framework path branched and you could either learn to use Angular or React (or both). Then we'd definitely have more interest in this room.
55c96a410fc9f982beacf1f7	FreeCodeCamp/React	2015-09-26T21:47:58.041Z	558646c815522ed4b3e238e7	miguelc1221	5607128eb25b32533216dba8	we gotta get more people in here!!

Now i just gotta figure out how to even make those endpoints lol

I completed FCC's curriculum last year before so much of it was brought 'in house' and am now going back and doing the zipline projects with react

I’m really light on my knowledge of using any buildtools when it wasn’t prebuilt for me by yeoman
55c96a410fc9f982beacf1f7	FreeCodeCamp/React	2015-08-11T03:26:22.765Z	55863c8015522ed4b3e23814	ltegman	55c96b5e8f067d637598d8b9	It only covers the barebones basics, but I really liked this article by the facebook team: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html
