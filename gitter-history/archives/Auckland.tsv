We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

559391e315522ed4b3e324eb	FreeCodeCamp/Auckland	2015-09-21T09:49:36.947Z	54d29d8fdb8155e6700f751f	dragonraij	55ffd2b00ed44a00046f33a5	I would be interested in something like that a lot. I am very much a beginner though.  A group like this can have lot of potential in regards to learning and motivation
559391e315522ed4b3e324eb	FreeCodeCamp/Auckland	2015-09-21T08:50:36.295Z	559fac510fc9f982beaa69d8	MichaelGreenNZ	55ffc4dc9f9fabb6673e5f31	I’d be interested in a meet-up, I’m still fairly early in the process, and I notice since i was last on there are some new HTML/CSS waypoints. So i’m going to go back and do those now.

Looking around at the moment to find a venue and will be in touch when I do. was thinking of an initial evening event and then see what interest there in from then on

If it works then we can think about having on a regular basis where we can meet up with our computers, have coffee and learn to code in a collaborative environment. Who would be interested in this?
