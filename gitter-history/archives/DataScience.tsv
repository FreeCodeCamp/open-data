1. Organize the course around a set of diverse case studies.
2. Integrate computing into every aspect of the course.
3. Teach abstraction, but minimize reliance on mathematical notation.
4. Structure course activities to realistically mimic a data scientist's experience.
5. **Demonstrate the importance of critical thinking/skepticism through examples.**

I like the 5th principle. Healthy amount of skepticism in your data and analysis is important :smile:  "

I have never worked as a DS. That said the job is very old and used to be not sexy. I came from mathematical visualization perspective. People do 'analog'  DS. That's what I rebellious call it. If you want to make inferences and predictions based on testable hypothesis with quality; then you enter the realm of formal DS. However there's a difference between mom and dad non-profit and large multi nationals. Everything in between as to playing around with excel and drop in a pie chart. DS comes with the task of educating the customer. So what should someone know? Coursera has a course building the data science team. I can recommend it. High end. But for everything else. I recommend creativity, skepticism. Love for scientific inquiry. Know programming.But above all e curious mind that can dig up many questions. Data cleaning because it is never nice. Realistic mindset because without DS interest it is unlikely that the best information already is accumulated.  Feature engineering is closely related to that. The ability to listen without dropping buzzwords. Optional putting on those sexy cloth ;-)

I craft my own learning path. The Moocs are all good. But since my own 'graduation' project is highly advanced I now started a dual track. I search for the knowledge I need and start using it. So I have my own research project that in the end must be proof of skills. I document my steps etc. this very practical hands on is still missing largely. It makes it harder to get a sense of workflow. Math can be an issue. However I find it less difficult when it is directly related to reality. So the stats and math concept I do on the fly. The first thing I noticed when exploring a freelance site was that the issues where not like the curriculum. So I got stuck and almost in despair. It is why I changed my approach. Hacking into DS. No easy fix and unpredictable difficulties create more confidence and knowledge. Even though at humble beginnings it will encompass a lot. Data cleaning, encoding, survey, nlp, ml and visualization of narrative etc. most courses take quite some time and combining them make you a full time student. As data cleaning is the most important thing in the process. I would suggest anyone who starts focus on that. It makes you I guess fast employable. Machine learning is as good as one knows where to look and where to find the data to combine.

Main points made:

- Location-based services and U.S. retail are showing the greatest progress capturing value from data and analytics.
- Machine learning’s greatest potential across industries includes improving forecasting and predictive analytics.
- Machine learning’s potential to deliver real-time optimization across industries is just starting to evolve and will quickly accelerate in the next three years.
- Enabling autonomous vehicles and personalizing advertising are two of the highest opportunity use cases for machine learning today.
- Designing an appropriate organizational structure to support data and analytics activities (45%), Ensuring senior management involvement (42%), and designing effective data architecture and technology infrastructure (36%) are the three most significant challenges to attaining data and analytics objectives. 
- U.S. retailer supply chain operations who have adopted data and analytics have seen up to a 19% increase in operating margin over the last five years.
- Design-to-value, supply chain management and after-sales support are three areas where analytics are making a financial contribution in manufacturing."

Adding: For someone trained in reading them, they are ok and in some situations even welcome. I think it depends on your audience...

Some additional references:
http://blog.scottlogic.com/2011/09/23/a-critique-of-radar-charts.html

The stacked charts/sparklines in this one would be my preferred option...
http://peltiertech.com/spider-chart-alternatives/

I have been using parallel coordinates. Although hard to follow and also requires some training, they offer much more possibilities. It is my impression that they are also more popular than radar charts for interactive projects:
http://duelingdata.blogspot.nl/2013/07/radar-chart-vs-parallel-coordinate-chart.html

My example (just demo with a hack from blocks and using FCC data):
https://bl.ocks.org/evaristoc/b6bb842a4ea3a4fca09d

In general:
If you think they are going to be very confusing, better to report simple numbers instead...
But again, don't discharge the radar ones..."

I think suffer from similar caveats as pie charts do. Not saying that I wouldn't use them though: they could be useful to show some differences between mapped attribute values between several different targets when those differences are an evident signature of the targeted phenomenon. But I found them difficult to follow visually and when comparing targets they are not really valuable if there differences are not huge.

##I went to meetups... Journalism+Code; Online Start-ups pitches 

**Journalism+Code**:
The introduction talk started being a more philosophical question about the Death of Journalism and the lost of credibility. An invitation to re-invent the journalist-being into a believer and doer and not a simple fact-provider. Forget the audience, just communicate the ""Truth"". 

Not that credible the introduction, :) , but the guy had a point. Hard to oppose the accepted paradigm that it is not just about communicating but also engaging the specific interests of specific audiences. Facts are not enough: fake news also sell well. And not forget the Dark Shadow of the Corporatism.

Then it came the turn for coders to ask what the programming problem was. The few journalists there suggested several ideas. Most of them were more about day-to-day solutions. A more radical view was a call to hacking bad guys to get info to report.

The information and the people there were very interesting, really. This one remains as a possible on-going project. Let's see: they were taking notes...

**Online Start-ups pitches**:
Excellent. Some of them offered interesting simple solutions. One was coincidentally about a journalist group that was approaching the audience and designing the communication and content strategy using similar approach to those for Website Optimisation.

The winning projects consisted in innovative approaches, adopting AI and implementing some kind of search engines or messaging. So that is: many people are backing:
* new ways to solve problems and formulate products, 
* using smart solutions and better if specific,
* and bringing some order to the Ocean of Information.

Without neglecting the power of the old school solutions (eg. oil industry or the fact that one of the Forbes' richest man is a mere retailer), when it comes to online it seems that using all tools available to solve an apparently simple issue counts... 

Was it Richard Branson? Something like: ""Any person can create difficult things. You have to be brilliant to create simple things that sell""."

I have been analysing the case for FCC though. I made a proposal for something similar some time ago. 

I kept the project on-hold for technical reasons and currently the data management is more scattered, although no silos exists.

One of the issues I have personally facing is how to get data from the different API´s of the different media campers are using. The API's are becoming restrictive, you have to pay for premium offers to enjoy access to more relevant information.

Then there is a question of data matching. Users of different platforms are registering using different mechanisms that make the tracing of the users difficult.

For any plan you could have about building a customised application, please consider those issues and try to find appropriate solutions. They could represent serious bottlenecks for your application to work efficiently and realiably.

Anyway contact me if you think you still want to try?"

##I went to a meetup today: PyData: wavenet and Panama papers

Very interesting today.

The first, insights about [WaveNet](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/), a neural network model to simulate the actual texture of raw audio. The sound of human voice was indistinguishable (think of Siri: you quickly get it is a robot...). What it is still not solved is assigning real language to that artificial voice though. We went through a code written in [Keras](https://keras.io/): very nice!

 The second was about the [Panama papers](https://panamapapers.icij.org/) problem, and analysing the data using [networkX](https://networkx.github.io/) and [community API](http://perso.crans.org/aynaud/communities/index.html). I also commented through this channel a previous meetup this summer where the same problem was analysed using [neo4J](https://neo4j.com/).

We also bring the internet with us to these places. 2. The API comes into play because we hope to be able to distribute this to schools, track users, and target talented students to enroll into a more intensive program. It would be great to be able to compare user performances in villages with english speakers who have internet access.  Currently we are developing internship programs with universities  Kathmandu which will have student developers teaching code in their home village and collecting data from the standalone app. 3 We have started designing functionality to add to  FCC that incorporates language learning alongside web development  (think Duolingo and FCC babies.) 3. One of our main goals is to create economic self-sufficiency. So we want to train up developers and ultimately give them work.

* FCC already has a group working on translations. Please contact them directly to know more? In my experience, translations are hard to implement for very extensive projects without a lot of help and commitment, particularly for an ever-changing project like FCC. So far, the most successful translation project I know is a Chinese FCC clone.
* The standalone idea is veeeery interesting... the only question mark in my opinion would be why to teach standalone web development in areas with poor internet connectivity? Still, I think the idea could be successful!
* What you want the API for? There is a hold-on project for an API to get data about FCC stats and FCC campers; the project could progress possibly next year. I don't have information about other uses for the API but it is worth finding out.

If your idea is to develop a very specific project based on FCC, just remember that this project is open source and that you can clone it and modify it. However, it would be nicer if you contact the Team for a more specific project that could even guarantee the participation of several other campers that are at the NGO Contribution section, IMO.

I might contact you later for more details?"

##Projects: Facebook's City Group search re-design; DataScienceRoom website

Extending new invites for people to participate in different projects that could be hosted by DS-Room regulars?

The first project is refactoring a project that was made to analyse City Group (f. Campsites) activity on Facebook. The refactoring is currently reserved to people who already worked on the first part. The idea is to use data now registered in the forum as the wiki was moved from Github instead.

The second project already has a first dirty effort. I would like to extend another invitation to those interested. I think we are producing substantial interesting data in this room that could be valuable to share with other people.

If you are still not sure, check for examples of this kind of initiatives [now being posted in the forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/the-unofficial-freecodecamp-remote-pairing-noticeboard/59436). The number of people posting their work is growing. Some of those projects are **collective projects**, which is my main proposal. We produce information here in this channel and maintain a simple record of activities in a simple website for people who are interested. This is a project that would require some commitment (creating and then maintaining/updating/modifying the site, as well as elaborating over the content).

One possible way of entry is this iniative: the [Chingu cohorts](https://tropicalchancer.github.io/projectus/), which is a project started by some FCC campers.

Please let me know if someone is interested? Front-end, Back-end and maybe content management required."

##Reactive Extensions for a Data Science: a link

Currently very busy learning Angular2 and gladly coming across with one of the topics that motivated me to study JS and nodejs: [Reactive Extensions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1028250/what-is-functional-reactive-programming) or **Rx**.

For what I have seen so far, Rx are currently used more for data manipulation/transformation and not for analytics. One important reason is the nature of the stream data type as ""flux"" - Rx, as mentioned by the presenter in the video below, is not more than querying stream (in general async) data.

Analysing static, sync data is for now the preferred way for many kinds of analyses because many analytical methods require getting the dataset properties that will become parameters or attributes for the analysis. With stream data having those properties is harder or even impossible.

However Rx could solve interesting problems. Here an example:

##Meetup Today: H2O

[H2O](http://www.h2o.ai/) is a company developing a Free Software platform very similar to Spark but with different algorithms and possibilities. Rather that competing against each other, H2O and Spark are becoming complementary. H2O is ok hosting Spark code but for a better use you should know Scala or better Java (the source code). H2O makes a lot of use of JVM and makes a lot of its code portable through jars.

I think it could be interesting to go through it, I was informed today that H2O can be used in databricks (for those who completed the Spark code)."

It is just a suggestion. The idea is to bring part of the excellent material that it is being produced through this channel to other FCC users that are active in other channels but are unaware or not interested in joining the DataScience room, but are still interested in Data Science topics.

I made a test with a topic for a discussion and it didn't work, it seems forum is not currently an audience for that. 

I researched a bit more and got the impression that the best could be to post about books/courses we have already read/taken. If you or anyone takes the initiative of posting in the forum I suggest to keep the hashtag #DS (DS = DataScience) so we can easily find our contributions to the forum.

It could turn out that the only channel for nice material and topics in DataScience is this channel though ;) . It could be a bit of duplication too... I don't know...

I like our DataScience room..."

##Meetup Today: Advances in IoT and the New Society

Today I attended a meetup about strategic MS's Azure Hubs. The MS model for Azure is getting complex but powerful. It seems that MS plan is to offer large capabilities within **strategically defined hubs** of services oriented to an ecosystem of specific products.

One of those hubs is Events: a telemetry oriented hub for supporting devices remotely.  The other one is Analytics & IoT, which is about taking data from the device and analyse it.

When used together the possibilities are huge. With one, the data is captured through remote systems. With the other one, the data is analysed. The data could be used for a particular action:
* Control of the conditions the device is monitoring.
* Controlling the device itself (eg. maintenance).

The impacts, and in particular the social impacts, could be huge, with advantages and disadvantages. Eg. again, this would replace the need of specialists to monitor on those devices, or at least would encourage remote centralisation, rendering on-site human resources less relevant.

The impact of devices controlling themselves could have strong benefits, the human resource is less and less needed under this kind of society (if it realise and become sustainable). Here a impressive video about what the use of this devices for IoT could do. When watching, think about what for technician you will need to carry out the task. Good? Bad? Just different? And the payroll, how the company will consider the new personnel?

Yes but one needs to classify the knowledge also. Say cleaning on steroids. Deciding on relevance. I am still wrapping my mind on what it practically means. Sometimes the knowledge is just not simply structured. Complexity just obscures the accessibility. That is the point I am zooming in.

I am focussing on the skills how to minimal structure unstructured data and it's process.  I did my first google search on the topic. Untill now OCR has been very slow with lots of errors especially because I will be testing the Dutch language. The treasure throve is usually that what is not easily accessible. So I have to come up with a strategy to collect it. As for now I am thinking graph databases because I actually found graph theory remarkable feminine in its approach of thought. But I have never worked with it...exciting :fire:  adventure.

It's on github. I really like the clearity of the course. I enjoy it very much. If you are totally new to programming I suggest Coursera Mooc Python for text analysis. Very fun to do. Every course unlocks somehow different tidbits of knowledge. Untill now I haven't found the holy grail. But then that is the most interesting part good teachers come in various formats. I have found many of them to be no formal teachers at all. Google is your friend at least mine :-) It helps to become better at asking questions in order to find the deeper embedded knowledge.

##canvas and d3.js

I have been recently working my way into canvas. REALLY exciting! My plan is to work with both, canvas and d3.js, in the future. For canvas you require even more knowledge of plain JS + a lot more of maths, and specially Linear Algebra for the large majority of existing examples.

Here an old dated link on how to work with both:

##US Elections Polls: what goes wrong
You might be exhausted about hearing what happened and trying to explain the current Trump win. In my opinion, the real problem is not simply saying that the polls were wrong. I think it is unfortunately two-ways.

On one side, it is a fact that the pollers made wrong conclusions based on wrong data, by assuming they have the correct one. In all cases, polling people's opinion is not easy: data might not lie, but *people do*. However, some pollers were careful in saying that the chances for Trump were still high, even when giving Clinton a head. For example, [this article of the NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html) gave to Trump a chance to win ""the same as the probability that an N.F.L. kicker misses a 37-yard field goal"". The tree chart of the article is really revealing of what happened in the past elections: Trump won by winning the key states that the tree chart showed.

Not every poller got it wrong:  in [this article on USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/11/09/pollsters-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-2016-presidential-election/93523012/) it is said that Los Angeles Times/University of Southern California consistently estimated the correct outcome by making right  assumptions about the possible behaviour of Trump voters. And there was always some question marks, as [this article that I brought about 2 months](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/learning/lesson-plans/and-the-winner-is-predicting-the-2016-presidential-election.html) ago was telling.

The other problem is  what the non-trained public opinion really understands *about statistics*. We usually have the tendency to reduce the complexity of the uncertainty by making a probability looks like certain. Hillary has a better chance to win, but *the uncertainty was still high*. However, the public opinion took a *chance* as a *fact*. That could also happen to the Hillary's Campaign Team, which ended up ignoring states that were doubtful by assuming that they were already strong holds.

This and other polling errors are a remainder that:
* [Statistics is about chances, no facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness) - this is always hard to explain to the non-trained audience, who is always after facts
* They are efforts to model the reality, **not** the reality
* From the two above, be aware that even with wrong data and wrong analysis, you can *by coincidence* land to the *right conclusion* - this has happened along the human's history
* The conclusions are as good as the data and the analysis on the data; garbage in, garbage out
* The analyst don't have all the information required to make a conclusion - there is information managed secretly or hidden (for example, between senior executives)
* Events are not static ones - unexpected situations [can change the course of events](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3080121/ns/dateline_nbc-books/t/luck-factor/#.WCcRkd9yubl) whenever accompanied by the drive of ""making it happen"" - many wars [have been won/lost](http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-55970-515-8) that way. Luck also occurs in Science but it has a fancier name: [*serendipity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity). 

Big Data/ML etc alone are not going to be the answer: it is what we can really extract *correctly* and for our discussions *morally* from that information that really fits and generalises into the phenomena we want to explain."

Let's see: Although I definitively like OpenCL more, frankly speaking most of the material I have read for DL/ML goes around Nvidia. This is certainly a strong marketing strategy to drive adoption into Nvidia GPU's, but on the other hand it ends up being more convenient.

It is also more universal. But what about training? And Nvidia seems to be ahead, don't you think?

CPU based though. My plan is to start using GPU at some point this year, although I will have to use a cloud connection. No plans to buy a GPU for now. I will certainly use Nvidia with CUDA as it is the most popular.

##Meetups today: Hackathon for deep learning
Last Monday I attended a meetup that was a continuation of a previous introduction in deep learning. This time we had to solve the following problem using neural networks (recurrent or convolutional or both): decoding a [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code).
QR codes are meant to be read by machines. Considering there are already many apps used for decoding QR codes, the problem looks trivial at once but don't be fooled. The problem is VERY hard for a neural network. Just to give you an idea of how to decode it using human brain, [check this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NySnmmCR_ls). The algorithms for decoding are non-linear, as [this code](https://github.com/dlbeer/quirc/blob/master/lib/decode.c) might shows.

This is the meetup information:
https://www.meetup.com/The-Amsterdam-Pipeline-Factory-of-Data-Science/events/234828464/

There was no much progress in general but in my team we didn't even reach the final (I had a very bad laptop for this and I couldn't actively participate, one of the team mates have to leave earlier than expected and my another team mate was having issues solving Docker). Actually the team didn't go along very well that night at the end.

So I decided to make a plan for a subproblem on my own. Let you know, still working on it without pressure.

The problem proved to be so hard for people new to ML/DL that the organiser decided to try another section in the future. Keep you updated.

I was at a networking lunch on Thursday at Adobe. While talking to one man he told me that Silicon Slopes (Silicon Valley's baby sister in Utah... It's on a mountain) is already short on Datamancers and worried about the upcoming years where someone was saying there would be a shortage of 190,000 Datamancers. So, if anyone is willing to relocate and wants a Datamamcy job, Silicon Slopes wants you! Also, they've even taken the initiative. I was offered the chance to participate in master/apprenticeships ""professionally"" (that means $$$ right?) Remotely.

Now LinkedIn is occupying that space. Nostalgia is washed away and I need to find a new space to explore as deviant. Ronald Dahl was my favorite with the brains in a jar. Luka is like that.

##News from Outside World: Did you know about linkedin acquiring Linda.com?

Here an article commenting the takeover and how ""disruptive"" this is expected to be. I think I already commented some time ago but I am doing it again after [@revisualize' post](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=580e4963ab78365b2055c9ac) above. Again: the Online Training world is becoming REALLY hot. Google is also after another platform, I think is either Udemy or Iversity. So expect the big ones to start entering this Market. I have commented several times in the past the Online Learning Platforms are not new but are gaining momentum. It is worth keeping track on and even  participate.

##Meetups today: Customer Journey Analysis; Recurrent Neural Networks
I went yesterday to the following meetup:
https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Amsterdam/events/234940750/?comment_table_id=471971404&comment_table_name=event_comment

Both presentations were very good:
* The presentation by Gosia Wrzesinska focused on a simple technique they are implementing to show clicking behaviour after following the Customer Journey. Although not mentioned, core to the presentation was the use of [Rax](http://www.raxdb.com/), a interpreted language on top of SQL that they develop and that so far it is dedicated to make difficult time-based analyses on SQL. Hard to learn but it could be VERY useful. The team is formed by students from a Dutch university.
* The presentation by Rob Romijnders was more a good introduction to recurrent neural networks and their use. He also presented the use of recurrent neural networks to study heart-related disorders by identifying and predicting anomalies in cardiograms, as well as discussed the use in neural networks as an alternative to traditional time series analysis. Rob is also Open Source, having a github account, and writes frequently about Neural Networks."

I'm not far into it but my brother loved it so I thought I'd give it a read and recommend it here. It says its purpose is to explain why statistics matters, as opposed to how to statistics, and so far has been pretty good.

I had thought deeply about how to move established publishers into the right direction. But concluded they where too bulky, expensive and had the wrong mindset. So my website never came alive. Years later I learned the term disruptive and recognized the mindsets that had the advantage of time and resources. Adaptation and transformation are important in evolution and change. The most important lesson is to start, tinker and trust that eventually evolution solves the problem. If people say it can't be done or think only about obstacles I just think whatever. However now that knowledge goes fast; with limited resources it is also hard to enter as it is much easier to buy into an idea with money to blow. So data science is also about how to turn too complex questions into something you can handle on your own. My bucket list is huge😀😱

* Microsoft acquired the organisation that was in charge of R-evolution (R for Big Data)
* F# is a (much better) spin-off of C# with a stronger link to Data Science and it is also very much supported by Microsoft; the future contender of Scala?

Than academia are too much in an ivory tower. They better focus on guidelines; checklists or simple examples that attempt to avoid bias. There sre so many risk situations where such biases may occur.  An effort to avoid is like teaching good reasoning skills. Especially with insufficient math background people use off the shelf tools. Often output is blindly believed. The computer made the mistake is so widespread. Precisely because of the mathematification the effort should lie in human understandability of processes. Why does an alogorihm produce a bias.

##Meetups today: Social Responsible Data Science
In this opportunity I attended this meetup:
https://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Data-Science/events/232697475/

Both presentations were interested but perhaps the most interesting one of both was the last one, by a Statistician Prof. at Leiden University, who is also a phylosophist. He reminded the audience about how doing BAD statistics can take us to non-human centred decisions, but biased ones. We have discussed the problem here in this channel, specifically when referring the apparently bias of selecting over higher North American black people recidivism ranking based on machine learning algorithms, which was also used as example in this presentation. Interestingly, there is still no simple answer by people at the level of that professor about how to face that bias. He, as a humanist, suggests though that the best way to avoid the inhuman selection is by simply taking any sensible demographic out of the model. I  think this is a fair solution. Here another pair of links about the same topic of last week:

In the same meeting in an after-thought and chat I met a couple of people who are working on interesting projects in Data Science for Universities. One of them is working on a search engine for Data Science trainings between Dutch universities. It sounds simple but the actual technical implementation is tough as the material to be used for the search engine is not in a centralised database but scattered in many different places and formats.

The other person was on an start-up working on a (AI?) platform for education staff fully oriented to learn Math and Science for university students. The software is to help teachers to verify the solution of the problems students post as well as providing them advice about better ways to solve it. It is just like an assistant teacher that shows the required theory when needed but forces to iterate with several solutions until getting the right one. The system ""reads"" your solution and provides the best advice to your case. I tried the demo: no bad... The key offer of this cloud based tools consists in the following:
> Correcting homework and (practice) tests is not necessary anymore (sic). Intelligent feedback helps students where they need it. Our solution provides real personalized learning, even with large groups.

Also:
> A MOOC mostly contains theory, for example as video-lectures. The strength of our solution lies in our interactive elements, like exercises and tests, which offer immediate personalized feedback where needed. This is something a traditional MOOC can never offer.

It started 2010, so I must say it looks a matured stuff. The format also reminds me another learn-to-program platform developed here in the Netherlands for K-12 classes and that it has been recently deployed.

SoWiSo: have a look if you are just interested:

Join us for a special Python seminar, where attendees will create a data project in Python! 
During this class, we’ll run through the process of taking a data project from conception to data cleaning and reduction, all the way through to creating a visualization. Along the way, we’ll step through some basic arithmetic operations, justifying our choices with the goal of our study and the limitations of our tools.
This seminar will focus on introducing and immediately using tools in Python. 
Check out the full outline for the evening: https://codefellows.github.io/data-analysis-glance 

It's a pretty good walk-through to get your feet wet in a little data science-y stuff."

I'm doing now Harvard CS109; I like it. There are enough totally newbies in the room; so they teach very clearly. It's python based. However the resources are a bit difficult to get due to old flash player and often access denied problems. But as long as it works; it's great resource.

##Draft of a viz about topics in the FCC Main Chatroom

As you might know I have been working on ways to extract topics and summarise information from the chats. Recently I have exploring some already known techniques. After comparing their outcomes I decided to use Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for being:
* easy
* good enough for my computer capabilities
* effective

The results, albeit the usual subjectivity when analysing human behaviour and specially language, were actually acceptable.

Also you might have noticed that my interest would be to combine *message and social networks*. So I did an analysis also based on who talk about the possibly revealed topics.

I made a draft exploration of only one week and 6 extracted topics out of 20 possible ones. Usernames are given but the week analysed is not directly quoted. You can find a first visualization of this project in my codepen
http://codepen.io/ecccs/pen/yaxyEa

I will be open to your feedback.

##Designing Information - Information Types: there is more than one...
I am currently reading a book about Information Design and wanted to share some of the concepts with you. The book start by citing a historical reference to a quote attributed to Julius Caesar suggesting him as the person who said there were three types of information. His views were certainly politically driven but the classification deserves consideration by anyone who want to convey information to the public. According to the author of the book (J. Katz, *Designing Information*), there could be more than 3 classes to include other ways of ""Information"":
* Information = Facts disclosed to the audience
* Uninformation = Decoration of the Facts disclosed to the audience; according to the author it is here where the designer plays (*OBS*: not sure about this claim as the author suggested, but certainly playing with the ""Decoration"" of the Facts should actually amplify the effect of either information or non-information)
* Noninformation = Decoration that is made appears like Information when it is not, but that not necessarily mislead but rather confuse or distract the audience from the actual Information
* Misinformation = Non-facts, Lies masqueraded as Information; not necessarily deliberate, but always misleading; eg. wrongly analysing incomplete data as complete
*  Disinformation = deliberate Misinformation

I should add this concept for or change names to include:
* Undisclosed Information  = Facts that are not disclosed - it is a way of Uninformation to me, but not necessarily misleading when not of the interest of the public or because must be kept confidential

I would also add IMO:
* Hidden and Unhidden Information = talks more about the intention of the Information and how deep you should go to reveal the Fact that it is intended to be reported; more to do with Communication probably (other topic...)"

@cuent : again, nice the youtube link you gave us: we have been discussing some topics mentioned by her here. I think we can continue in that direction so we can have this channel as an additional reference also for that kind of discussions! Also interesting other GoTo Conference talks.

@erictleung Thanks! Have you experienced its use with some data? Share with us and specially with @cuent who is the person who first asked about!

@zarak here you go! excellent, thanks for the info!

@jacqueline-homan,  @jomcode, @razerh0 @darwinc : you brought the F# to this chat and now you managed to persuade some of us to start something with F#. Any place to start? We can list from your previous posts:

* http://fslab.org/
* http://evelinag.com/

Can you guide us? Please share!

##IoT in Amsterdam: turning into an Smart City - the Beacon Mile

(particularly @darwinrc but maybe @cuent and @luishendrix92? @Lightwaves?)

Who want to check and play with [this](https://amsterdamsmartcity.com/visit/amsterdam-beacon-mile)? Maybe a very small project here on our own? Something perhaps for Latinamerican users?

I can share with you some advances already done by some companies here, trying to get involved.

##Also... Skale project
Sorry about my lack of involvement in the skale project the last months. I am still interested but stuck with some basic stuff to be honest. I still suggest to keep an eye on that project, who knows what comes. Keep you updated."

It is gaining my interest more and more. In fact recently I am finding python bit too small and constraining...

T-SNE: a [Dutch person](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) seems to be behind the development of the technique? Reading about... Is that a sort of clustering technique? Or mainly representational, like Multidimensional Scaling? Hmmm... seems more like the last one... Looks VERY simple conceptually too! 
kNN *again!*, with apparently MC + binary search + back to t-Student and concepts in information theory to measure the loss function... 
Amazing how some simple stuff could be more effective than too complex implementations in the general cases... we were realising that in a discussion during the last meetup...
@cuent: for what I am reading, the key here is finding the ""probability distribution between pairs of high-dimensional objects"" and then the probability distribution of the similarity distance. Looks like a (double) Bayesian approach to me unless your approach is parametric... Also it is here where the sampling takes place: it could be a numerical approximation? It seems that involves a bit of tweaking if you get fancy.
Those are my first impressions, not sure if I am correct...
Not sure if you are interested just in the practice of the technique or also in the concepts? Don't know a course but for basic concepts I would suggest something in Computational Statistics if that is not your field: it could be valuable to understand the implementation.

Nice approach!"

The aforementioned workshop was REALLY productive, almost a class to understand basic Neural Networks, with a lot of feedback and me lucky to get into a very good team (everyone in teams of 3), with lots of good questions and contributions. It was more than just to go through the exercise.

I am in position to help you out with this one, so let me know if you will give it a go.

###Next Meetup...
The people organising that meetup are preparing another one in a form of a hackathon. I already managed to know the topic ( ;) ), so I will be studying for that day. The next time we will do some convolutional nn.

###A book...
One person in my team was using this book: *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by C. M. Bishop. Although topic-based, it seemed a very good book with a lot about neural networks."

The training is in python and we will be using the keras library . The material will be available and we can later share it if you decide to give it a go. It is in a container (docker). It is being said to be a large download - I haven't tried.

The problem to solve is the common hand-written digits classifier (https://github.com/sjoerddehaan/keras-tutorials/blob/master/mnist%20with%20keras.ipynb).

> Balancing between time consuming coding and math is like juggling

I agree! To combat this, I've thought about doing both, coding the math you learn. I've been meaning to brush up on linear algebra and found this course on Udacity https://www.udacity.com/course/linear-algebra-refresher-course--ud953 . Looks like they plan on teaching you to write your own linear algebra library. Coding something will really test if you know something.

So in my opinion, bringing equations and the math out from being just static symbols and numbers to more interactive functions you can play around with, you can interact and understand the implications of different values in those equations. I hope that helps."

For simple DS what most people use is actually no more than the 5 summaries when exploring the data. I found R not that hard. However one need to get used to the syntax a bit. But that said, the advanced statistic topics; yes they need some extra study. For a person to succeed there are enough open course ware books that can shed a light on it. Next step is doing the advanced MOOCs. You can teach R at university research level or at highschool level. There is a difference between heavy tech industry and just small to medium sized companies that want to explore some data. Untill now I haven't seen much impressive use of DS in most of the companies. There's still much advocacy/ work to be done. Statistical literacy is not that high on average. As soon as people sense math; they lose interest.

@mesmoiron :) this book in my opinion doesn't need more requirements than the basics.

Then some graph algorithms would be also handy."

Unusual: normally the emphasis is purely analytical. This approach is more from physics. Are the authors physicists? This approach is also very useful to understand multidimensionality, which is the key of many Data Science problems and understanding random point generators.
All the first part of the book emphasises parametric statistics, particularly Gaussian.
The same approach (Gaussian, Vector Space, etc) goes for the second chapter but this is not unusual. SVD is a VERY important transformation, and it is key for many other ones in parametric statistics.
Then, for the graph part, some welcome combinatronics. Good! The random generation of triangles in a graph and then the derivation of the variance of a graph based on them is *wow* for its simplicity! Excellent. And then transitions... those guys are physicists... This is the chapter I am more interested...
Analysing Markov theory after graphs is a BIG plus. Definitively a approach based on space representation. @erictleung: relevant for you if you want to go Biotech this chapter.
And it is not until all that theory that you start the Machine Learning part... OK!!! Good! Ending with algorithms for big data...

However I found siri annoying because it could not sense my working routine. When to bother me asking or not. But those interactions make you think really what interactive communication is really about.
@albert2309 quantifying human values I think that is interesting too. However values can be derived from what is said or written, but also from what is avoided or not written. That space can be huge. As long as you miss out on detailed life experience it is hard to do it accurately. New York Times had I believe an article on that. Lastly I like camperbot because it is distinctly a bot; I would not be sure if people like a bot that is identical to humans. It falls almost in the category of transgenders; the amount of people who set the changed gender equal to all specific details is much lower than accepting it for the sake of other having well being in their lives. And that is hidden from ML  as for now. Complexity is about details, details I think; even tiny details count."

I did a first draft for analysing extinction trends precisely for amphibians (including frogs and toads):
http://evaristoc.github.io/viz_exer/endangered_amphibia/

I studied biology as first major at uni, with interest in evolution theory. If the current trends maintain I am afraid there is a big risk of mass extinctions in the next years: large groups of phyla that will disappear forever. We don't still feel the consequences of that phenomenon, but we will...

For me the future of IT would be the pursuit of quantifying everything, from water temperature using IoT to targeting audience for advertisement using Machine Learning. The quantification allows us to create a better and accurate result and provide a way for robots to interact more since computer are great at calculating but not reading emotions. Companies will also face more challenges on privacy issues because some people do not want to have their data used. I also predict that our lifestyles will be get disrupted more thanks to startups. Drones will be a part of our lives more, too. 

However, while I predict IT will have a better future, I am afraid that the future of sustainability will be worse. I noticed that people are getting less aware about the environment especially in developing countries.

> We can either create a biased model without realizing it or our data can be biased
> So we have to be hyper-aware of that 

And *this* is why making sure we're starting out with accurate raw data is so important. 

For example, what does our raw data model actually reflect, or is it a flawed raw data set to begin with? 

Is race really a predictor of recidivism rates or is it a more systemic non-race based issue such as the only economic options for survival being ""bad choice"" vs. ""worse choice"" for those with criminal records and juxtaposing that against the backdrop of insufficient opportunities for the general population of non-offenders  in a shrinking jobs market (due in large part to technology and globalism making a significant part of the job-seeker pool redundant - or as Karl Marx referred to as ""surplus labor"").  

Asking the broader question of ""_what happens to those who've been economically left out in post-Welfare Reform America_"" would require us to put on our researcher hats to gain more knowledge for responsible data aggregation and application of statistics and other data science tools. 

**Three significant and much overlooked facts:**

1. In the US, as horrible as the whole privatized for-profit Prison Industrial Complex is, prison is often the only option for obtaining food, housing, and medical care for a growing number of people. 

2. The overwhelming majority of the people in prison are people from poverty. (Does this mean that poor people are more inherently criminal and anti-social than the more advantaged and privileged? Does this mean that we're seeing the result of hopelessness and despair due to a real lack of opportunities and a real lack of a legit social safety net? How many offenders  were actually innocent but couldn't afford lawyers and DNA testing that would prove they were wrongfully incarcerated and then rendered 100% unemployable due to having records after release on parole, etc? )

3. Whether someone is innocent of the crime they're arrested for or not, pleading guilty can (and often does) mean the difference between doing only a few years prison time vs getting slapped with a sentence where you won't be eligible for release until you're way too old to work (even if you _could_ find someone willing to hire you as an ex-felon).  

The information coming back to us from those who volunteer to teach in prisons, if we're receptive to what they have to say, is that the inmates with the shortest sentences are those who copped a plea deal - regardless if they were innocent or not. (What does this say about how our legal system works and about recidivism?)

Christopher Hedges, who teaches literary skills to prison inmates, brings these little known facts up several times.  

Which is why the first question anyone in data science should be asking is the proverbial grail question: ""who is benefiting?""

But the coolest tool is our willingness to question whether or not we are starting with an accurate data model in the first place. It is perfectly acceptable to question everything when dealing with the raw data that was aggregated and getting other engineers to weigh in with questions about it, too. (Again, this all boils down to asking the right questions - some of us might miss something vital that some others of us catch).

 A silly and trite example would be to imagine the application of all these cool data science tools to a badly flawed raw data model -> treating the data model of a fruit and nut cake the same way we would treat the data model of a Ford truck brake assembly. The former is a recursive data tree while the latter is more like a binary tree.  Incorrectly modeling the former as the latter would result in fatalities due to food allergies. 

So bottom line: Never feel that you can't question the raw data you are given to work with and re-model it if necessary. "

I do think at least some organisations are trying to do this Invisible people and Prison Reform are amongst those that I follow on Twitter. But I do think that they lack the computational resources and basic survey skills (the smaller organisations in Holland at least do). It is my goal to enter the vacuum, but it would be a very small contribution. It will be harder and harder for organizations because of the knowledge gap. Financialization and mathification of services leave the strong ones with the brains and capacity/resources to manipulate every attempt to increase well being for the bottom poor or under priviledged. I have had the discussion with the Black Lives Matter, that I pointed out that maybe only a few persons tend to educate themselves in being more effective counterparts. As the role models are quite busy selling expensive gear to their followers instead of donating to learning opportunities or grants on a larger scale.

 Even with new jobs being created, many Americans in deep poverty because of joblessness remain 100% shut out of the economy - especially the long-term unemployed over age 40.

 And age discrimination impacts women and minorities much harder because of the sex and/or race discrimination that also impacted us resulting in opportunities denied (which translates to  real deprivation of income and access to medical and dental care) throughout our lives before many of us got to be ""too old"" for anyone to deem us a ""good fit"" for being hired - regardless of how hard we worked at building skills or what we tried. 

The life expectancy rate for America's poor (across all racial lines) has dropped to just age 60 since Welfare Reform. The life expectancy rate for the middle class and the affluent is age 80. 

 Pulitzer prize winning journalist Christopher Hedges recently debated former US Labor Secretary Robert Reich on _Democracy Now!_ and he talked extensively about the appalling conditions of poverty (not just for people of color but also whites, too - the majority of the people who are among the ranks of the jobless poor and/or homeless in the US are white). 

And if anyone were interested in a data-gathering project, try counting the number of people in tent cities who are over age 40 that ended up losing everything and becoming homeless because of not getting hired/re-hired (and often also getting hit with the double whammy of a major health crisis while unemployed, too) despite having ""re-tooled"" and learning new skills. Age discrimination (as well as sex and race discrimination and deeply entrenched classism) is a *huge* problem and the burden is unfairly placed 100% on the victims instead of on those who are the gatekeepers who are doing the discriminating in hiring.  (And the ""winners"" who are able to leverage their privileges (white, male young, and middle class/rich) to get all the good jobs and other economic opportunities certainly aren't sharing their paychecks with those who lost out to them who are being shut out and sent away poor and empty-handed with no job opportunities. Society's ""winners"" have no sense of noblesse oblige here in the US.)

Being sent away poor and empty-handed with no job due to age or any other kind of discrimination -> no way to provide for your basic living needs.

Before Welfare Reform, we had a way of counting the number of people in poverty that were shut out of opportunity. But now we only have morgue and prison stats. To the best of my knowledge, no one is attempting to count the number of destitute people struggling for their lives in ""tent cities"" - they would rather the poor and homeless just not be seen or heard.

I am personally against the idea of maintaining a status quo of no real safety net for the jobless poor and having only a patch-work of NGOs/charities as the only safety net and as the only poverty alleviation solution. The charity/NGO model is not working for helping the poor up onto their feet and lifting them out of poverty because the problem  (and its symptoms) is systemic and structural.

 Most desperately poor people in dire need are turned away and NOT helped with what they need: incomes and medical care - hence a burgeoning homelessness and poverty problem that is not getting better for those who've been economically pushed out and who remain shut out of the job market due to age discrimination.  (But charity execs and paid staff sure always seem to get paid and have health benefits.)

I have traded forex for a while, but I also want to be able to program and test strategies. So then you just dive in.  I'm not afraid of autodicatic learning. I will piece together my knowledge. Fear not ;-) For now I'm just doing everything under the radar...

He even makes the statement that most people in industry like quants don't know their statistics and hence wreck havock in finance and politics. Yes I don't have a degree either, but I am blessed with a statistical mind that is I tend to see where the errors of reasoning lie without the ability to calculate  it. Taleb call that Fat Tony-people. To understand is not always necessary to know statistics as it obscures good thinking by making things more complicated than it should be. Hence it will be used by clever person without good intention like greed etc. Anyway I am studying statistics as much as possible, but mainly to spot bad statistics and to be able to explain why it is bad. I must say I don't see many people do this or even aspire one tiny bit. I too had to overcome my hate for statistics, because it alienates the human too much. Everything becomes a number. My curiosity started when I noticed that people homeless etc often lack good reasoning skills and they are more and more depending on people having the skills to advocate there cause. So I focused on making clear with government officials that people needed good tools that can calculate and 'reason' for them. To make it visible what the good choices are.  I realised that I was very lonely in holding that position; because economics tend to drive people where the money most easily is available. Doing long hours of study statistics is not compelling for many as a means to improve their lives.

Data is good as it can: you have to understand it and try to correctly use it. Otherwise, the quote: ""There is lies... and statistics"" would fit completely.

This applies to stats, as to many other sectors:
>Garbage in, garbage out.

Wrong analyses, wrong conclusions.

In general there is a lot of misleading out there. Unfortunately is a wide-spread bad practice from which people are even becoming richer or powerful: misinformation. Why? The general opinion doesn't understand statistics. So it is more a question of responsibility from the researcher to provide true information, respecting the right of the people of not having to know statistics, which it would be unrealistic anyway.

My personal opinion? When not about the scientific sector, I am ready to tolerate some license from some people to softly manipulate information in order to commit an audience if no-one is hurt, particularly if it is not for a bad cause and up to certain level of falsity. However there is a threshold I am not ready to bear. I hate very bad use of stats even when used to support things I am in favour. One thing is supporting a cause, another is lying.

One of the problems the sector is currently facing is in fact the large amount of people who has got a Data Science degree with poor knowledge of statistics, for example. There are a LOT of data scientists out there that are more ""tool-driven"" without a proper understanding of the analyses. Unfortunately, old fashion school, there is no good conclusions without a good analyst: tools won't do that for you all the time. And the more complicated the case, the more you require a strong statistics background and knowledge about the sector you are analysing. Otherwise, the chance that you reach an incorrect conclusion would be tremendously high.

@Lightwaves just review the video of the Spark course about the conclusions from Google about the decline of facebook using Google Trends and how facebook replies."

As always after some time it will be mainstream. Open source will continue to lower starting points faster. We will arrive at faster PCs because they are still poring out old models. It will take some time to become less elitists that is once schools know how to update faster with less budget and girls see the point of fun doing it at school. It thrives much on bubbles before it settles in reality. Predictions made 30 years ago are now becoming mainstream. So the fancy things from  today will then much comfortable to work with as it has reached critical mass. IT threat is still steep learning curves as a churning market need tools that people can use in a fast manner to transition. For too many people the investment in knowledge is still to cumbersome. When women enter the field pay tend to go down. What can be seen as a lowered entrance or positive as sharing becomes the reciprocal collaborative rule. Shoot me some arguments ;-)

That if you look at numbers one can paint different pictures. Like increasingly people with high degrees have to accept non conform jobs. Maybe a shift is going in. From lockstep to flexibility.

It is not enough to have a narrow minded goal. Pick offenders. Reducing crime is about addressing the root cause. A holistic approach would be to prevent by deferring creating opportunities. It is to easy to stick to low hanging fruit. That's why US has overcrowded prisons and The Netherlands don't. It is not only about using it; but how you use it.

http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/3/10895804/st-louis-police-hunchlab-predictive-policing-marshall-project

Due to racial tensions in the US, I'd like to bring up a bit of a ethical dilemma.

Should prediction software use race as a feature as part of it's prediction either in the case of crime prediction or attempting to predict Recidivism, I'll explain two of my opinions on both sides of the argument. On the yes side by incorporating race as a feature it would possibly increase the accuracy of the model due to latent factors.

On the no side, it could create what I would call a ""Race bias"" whereas the software would more likely peg a minority at a much higher risk of reoffending  just on the basis of the race feature maybe again due to latent factors."

###People
##Yesterday I went to a meetup about Data Science for Social Welfare
The most interesting presentation went about **Amsterdam ""Smart City"" project and the social effects of Big Data governance**. Amsterdam has plans to become one of the Smart Cities in Europe. However there are many questions about the implications of becoming a Smart City:
* First of all: What means to become a Smart City?
* Also, how much data do you need from people to make a city Smart?
* Then, what are the social impacts? Would a Smart City really increase the social welfare of all inhabitants or just a few (the connected ones, the richest ones)? Is really Smart City a more Inclusive City?
* Is a Smart City a more democratic one? For example: **privacy**: what means *privacy* for the user? How can a government implement measures to protect the right of privacy and the right of *not being tracked* without *affecting their social welfare and costs*?
* Then data security and efficiencies: How do you protect and make an efficient use of the user data in a usually very bureaucratic, silo-oriented organisation like a governmental one? Who would manage the data? The privacy sector? The public sector? Both? What need to change in the government infrastructure and organisation in order to  use the data more efficiently and effectively?

One of the main concerns that caused more discussion was that about **individual privacy**: it is likely that the cost of privacy could increase, and that only those who have enough income will be able to protect their privacy: the rest will be either exposed or not included in the social welfare system: **privacy could become a expensive good in a heavily big-data-dependent community**.

Not mentioned during the presentation was the fact that **big data and data science is overrated when it comes to its ability to really bring the actual picture of the population and individuals**. As we have discussed here (particularly @erictleung), it is not totally appropriate to affirm that having the data and implement some good methods that minimise the error is enough: the pattern that you find in the data might not be representative of the social architecture, which could be more complex and absent from the data.

In fact, a similar issue about the risks of basing actions crudely on data only could be found in another study about the implementation of [Big Brother surveillance](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37411250) devices in Oakland and the concerns about increasing social discrimination. 

In short, data patterns should have a sensible social interpretation, not technocratic one, if you want the social welfare to become a reality. Recognising the exclusion, either by lack of access or due to own choice, should be also relevant.

The presentation by Linnet Taylor was a summary of a preliminary report that you can find at:

Open Source technology is king when it is about emerging start-ups, but those start-ups usually shift into proprietary technology once they have reached a certain level of maturity. Why? They need to pay less attention to techs and more to sales and clients. For some of them focusing on tech could be a distraction at some point. Also, big providers of services (like IBM) are usually big clients (like for example a Marketing Consultancy company). A company might adopt a proprietary product not only because will be well serviced but also because ""it is *the product of my main client or investor (let's say MS)*"".

As an analyst I find very interesting how all those companies are trying to make business... the hard part of working on this is the *political* part, that part the data can not tell you about, the secret meetings between top CEO's, that phone call, the confidential email or the results of an conversation in a dinner or bar. When it comes to analysing this kind of things, most of the time analysts presume to have a lot of data to bring conclusions, but there are unexpected actions or decisions we are not always aware of, really."

> probably more production systems still use standard SQL technologies

Also checking some interesting reports on Internet and found that actually what it is happening is that **Open Source products might be eating the market of proprietary ones** in the case of relational databases.

At least a projection in 2015. So I think the big ones are just for the time being trying to capitalise through certification and post-services, pretty much exploiting the open source capitalization model, I guess. I haven't paid attention to this one though..."

By the way... (@erictleung)
##Did you know that MS is now the owner of R-evolution Analytics and R Server?

MS, as many other big ones, is investing a lot on acquiring Open Source technology nowadays. The last year was the time for [R-evolution Analytics](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2015/04/06/microsoft-closes-acquisition-of-revolution-analytics/). I was actually unaware until I found that the logo of a training  I took with them 3 years ago changed into MS on my linkedin just few days ago.

But this is important. For those who don't know what R-evolutions does, they were mostly focus on on the Big Data applications and libraries of R and a sort of Nonprofit consultancy/certification organisation, just like Cloudera is for Hadoop technologies.

Much of the current Open Source technologies will stay so, but in the future **certification** will be the way to go, just like it has been for MySQL (first Sun Microsystems, then Oracle). It happens that for many big organisations acquisition is a way to kill the innovation, not necessarily by avoiding its use but by deterring continuity and slowing down momentum in favour of their in-house products.

By the way, who have heard about MySQL since the takeover by Oracle? Is MySQL still in use? Nowadays Nonsql is more popular though."

I made a comment on it with a wink: *That sounds familiar. Do engineers have found their artificial children? Raising and educating humans is the go to algorithm of choice to produce highly sophisticated learners. From that perspective we have chosen the the most slow, costly way to reproduce what nature already had figured out and the brain did evolve for a reason or natural law. Deep learning can be quite useful and nothing wrong with it as long as one does not mistake the map for the landscape. That is something that is easily done if we trust too much on what is discovered. Hence things like over medication because complexity is blurred. Drawing lines are choices too. Humans are great at pushing other humans in unnatural positions that only happen to be harmful over the long run. How long have engineers been working on deep learning. How old is their child now?*

Normally you pick the first listed value in the comparison (you can get a ranking based on similarity) but you can always choose from a group of the best ranked ones.

At the moment I can't answer I will later share with you a project that might explain better that technique."

You need to know what you want to search for, what phenomenon you can imagine, combinations, influences, processes. But as always the themes may not be interesting to you. As for me I do not like business metrics for now. But I like physics processes that can help me imagine new things about large  interecting structures/agents etc. Lets put it different. With all the metrics in place. Amazon has not yet confinced me to go shopping with them. That is what I find interesting about a possible phenomena in DS. The grey, messy areas.

I've got a physics masters (with little statistics, programming experience). The more I read about the types of positions, the more worried I get about this decision. I'm worried that I'm not 'curious' enough, which seems to be a main theme of the big data course I'm taking. Data Scientists here, what sort of positions do you currently hold and what kind of data do you usually work with? If I were to get into data science I would have to be interested in the result of the analysis...

Books thrive on imagination. However coding books tend to be very technical and lack most often everyday methaphores. Just the way you would explain something to a kid/or someone outside heavy domains. Next (I am also a beginner formal datascientist) as oppose to an intuitive natural datascientist. Yes people can do that the old fashion way and I am good at that. What I find more trickier with datascience is to come up with good, fair and ethical narratives of the thing you are researching. Whatever the topic, Netflix clients, Ebay shoppers or economics, public publicies etc. So datascience is also about complexity and how to model that. I could go on philosophical about that. But it is very interesting. My start was at Coursera.

Check the guide that @samuelantonioli is providing. @koustuvsinha already did a small project with FCC data using convolutional: excellent to get idea of structures. I know python is not your thing but check the following material we have checked here before: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/. Andrej Karpathy is the person you have to check if you want to know more.
However, be aware that Conv-NN are REALLY tricky to tune. I was in a short master class about its use in Text Mining and you have several parameters to take in consideration in order to come up with something decent, which means a long Search Grid, which mean a lot of training. Also being careful in selecting how to implement an appropriate Error Function for your case is relevant (L1 or L2 or both?). I also remember we were talking in that class about bootstrap functions that re-normalise the values of the solutions between layers to be applicable for the case study we were evaluating, so... ufff!"

I haven't tried any GPU programming so far but I am not sure about those 6GB for a quick training.

Of course it depends on the size of the training/test datasets you have available. But someone else might give you a better answer here?
The article is really a good introduction. If you make some code eventually please share with us here? I would like to know more about GPU programming myself...
@alicejiang1 the size of the data is HUGE. You should start thinking about how to get enough hardware for that. As @samuelantonioli is pointing out, some idea of GPU programming might come handy for this one too. Actually, very specially for this one. Of course there are ways to find solutions to this...

I've read a very comprehensive [guide](http://timdettmers.com/2014/08/14/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/) but I'm still unsure what accuracy I have to expect after several pooling layers. Did someone try Tensorflow implementations of [those projects](https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet) on this GPU (although I know that TF may be slower)? Would be glad to hear some GTX 1060 users.

@alicejiang1
And the music project sounds like fun, [this project](https://github.com/unnati-xyz/music-generation) seems to do the same. Maybe it's easier to train two models: one for generating sheets of music based on training data (e.g. outputting MIDI files which encode relevant information for synthesis, like  [DeepJazz](http://deepjazz.io/) which uses MIDI files for training) and another one which synthesizes the sound. This may enable the second model to use music by e.g. Mozart and synthesizing it using modern/rock sounds (like ""A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"" for music, although I think that [artistic videos](https://youtu.be/Khuj4ASldmU) are conceptually more similar to music generation than generating one image) and you may profit from TTS research. Google Brain with [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/welcome-to-magenta) seems to be very interested in that topic, too.

The research of David Cope ""Experiments  in Musical Intelligence"" may be interesting for you, I was stunned when I first heard his creation [Emily Howell](https://youtu.be/QEjdiE0AoCU) which is able to analyze structure and repetitions in its training data.

Maybe it's a funny idea to use DQN and Reinforcement Learning techniques, but I wouldn't know what the reward function should look like.
Another spontaneous idea would be to encode the pitch as a number and use n-grams Markov model to create music based on trained music - I'm not sure if this is a good idea or would generate good music, but I've seen it to [create poems](http://www.fullstackacademy.com/blog/romance-js-programming-valentines-day-poetry). Music is normally very structured and this may help to assign appropriate probabilites and imitate that structure of chorus and verse.

Someone was able to something tangent with art where you yourself would sketch something and then run the drawing through an algorithm and then it would pop out a drawing that is in the style of one of the famous artists.

I couldn't find the software that does that. However, while trying to look for that, I stumbled upon something even cooler!

About Ethic, I have been attending to several meetups about the Ethic of Data Science for a while. It is becoming an issue now that in the near future Europe, for example, is planning a new law for privacy protection. They are focused meetups, that's why.

@cuent I think I will have a look, although right now I feel like I should try not to do too many things... About skale, no really.  I have been in contact with them and they released a new version and now they are in beta in cloud, which is exactly what they want. I am really interested but at the moment I am stuck with other small project. @cuent: would you have a preference about a topic you would like to go through? I am trying to think of something that could be of broad interest. It should be something that we can all discuss and go together. @darwinc and @luishendrix92 could be probably interested in knowing more about this project too. @darwinc was already checking the tool.

So far, I know the following:
- My interest is broad, but currently I am get an update in text mining techniques and social networks and I would have a preference for User Life Cycle analysis; I would like to take some into viz too
- @darwinc is interested in IoT
- @alicejiang1 is interested in Face Recognition (I will share something with you later, by the way...)
- @Lightwaves is interested in IT networks (so graphs could be his topic...)
- @ericleung is about Bioinformatics
- @luishendrix92 has a general interest in DS topics at the moment
- if I am not wrong, you are more into Eng?

We should find a technique and a problem that is common place for several areas, I guess. I could check what it is in the list of kaggle that could be interesting..."

Additionally I feel like I got a better understanding of Scala-like code after learning JS the right way.

But where are you doing Scala? That it is a big stuff!!! Why are you finding that so difficult?

I will continue with high level languages for a little while but come back to Spark now and then. And I have still to try skale, that it is also importing some naming for operations from things like Spark/Scala. So a good play ground."

I've started learning Scala and it's been a bit tricky to gain any momentum, but I think I prefer it to Python.

@erictleung @albert2309: the problem suggested by the book is unfortunately not new and it is more concerning nowadays. Have you ever hear the quote: ""There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.""? It was popularised in USA by Mark Twain back to 1900's but it is believed to be older than that...
You can see some back use of those tools in every election period ;)

@ascheist Interesting... reading about it just now: I heard of it just once, in a meetup with one of the founders of Apache Spark (they seem to be working on something there in Berekeley...), but never since... Are you doing some? Can you comment about your experience? Topological approach seems to be more mathematical, with strong use of algebra and with a lot of applications in time series analysis. My background includes classic frequentist statistics mostly, although I have been studying modern approaches lately, particularly bayesian and then ML, but never used topological approaches before. Any good reference? Python or R?"

In my opinion some of your previous questions might already be partially ""answered"":
* do they work for a registered 501(c)(3) charitable organization?
* does their organization have a budget specifically for technology? (*Many of them don't*)
* what types of software do they spend money on? (*Usual needs in general are admin and CRM, is this your question, @CodeNonprofit?*)
* is there an existing software solution for their use case?
* do they make use of free solutions? (*Currently many vendors are offering their services for free, so careful with wording...*)
* who in the organization is deciding what software to use? (*Not sure about this question...*)
* how long have they used their current solution? (*Why the question? What do you want to know?*)
* how satisfied are they with their current software solution? (*Depends who you ask, you will have very different answers... not sure about this one...*)
* how can we best spend our volunteer efforts on nonprofits? (*What do you have to offer?*)

Why we want to know:

* We’re curious where nonprofits are overpaying for technology the most (*Depends... actually they are barely paying for, that's the problem!*)
* We want to allocate our scarce resources (volunteers) carefully (:+1:)
* We want nonprofits to understand, through our open data results, how other organizations are using technology (*Better case studies?*)
* We want nonprofits to learn about off the shelf solutions, but also that custom code is a thing (:+1:)

I think that the survey could make a better impact if:
* Supports what it is already known (so not re-inventing the wheel...)
* Emphasise on topics like the use of Non-Vendor Free Software customised options in the market (your last point: off-the-shell):
  * Which organisations are more prone to use them?
  * Why? What are their focuses? When an off-shell is more convenient? When is NOT a preferred option?
  * What makes those organisations different to those that don't use off-shell? Innovative? Has a specialised staff and tech projects? Is it younger than counterparts? Has no budget for vendor options? Are activists in favour of Open Source?
  * What are their needs compared to other organisations?
  * Which organisations knows about those opportunities and how many are prepared to use them?
  * Would the organisation thinking that current solution could be replaced by a vendor solution at some point instead? Why?
  * If you use a VENDOR solution, would you replace that for a OFF-SHELL if the off-shell offers the same results? What do you expect to get in exchange of that change?
  * What are the main needs of non-vendor users?
* The questionnaire could consist in TWO based on screening: one for those organisations with only Vendor-based technology needs (shorter) and another for organisations that use or would like to use Non-vendor-based ones. HOWEVER take in consideration that FRONT-END is largely a sort of NO-VENDOR, so... how to discriminate? You can ask if one of their priorities is Front-End and then what other tech priorities they have...
* I don't know if the survey will reach the representative sample required for an statistical generalisation. No opinion about this... As well, I imagine those organisations are hard-to-reach ones, not sure about it...

Hope this helps..."

Some researches, questions made and results - for the benchmark:
* One survey in US (2014). Regional but can be extended to broader context:
http://fccfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-FCCF-Nonprofit-Technology-Paradox-report-2014.pdf
* This is a study that looks well done (2015), with good attention to the design - it looks trustworthy? - but **bad presented** :
http://www.slideshare.net/npowernw/501-commons-washington-state-nonprofit-technology-needs-survey
* An analysis of trends suggested for last year:
http://blog.capterra.com/biggest-nonprofit-technology-trends-2015/

For what I see, @CodeNonprofit, the challenge IMO is to identify those nonprofit organisations that:
* rely on Open Source for some of their activities
* have programmes and project that are technologically-based; I expect though, that if the nonprofit/NGO has a technologically-based program, they will have the required staff and budget for it - so their needs may lay somewhere else!
* where the current existing solutions offered by main vendors are NOT what the organisation is looking for, but actually requires some kind of customised solution for its project/program to stay ahead
* where for some reason, they cannot get commodity products for the most general needs

---

Some recommendations based on that information (off-focus, opportunities):

* Apparently FCC should offer training about Cloud Solutions?

* Another aspect to put attention to is the *gap of the available training for NGO's and nonprofit regarding Technology*. This is something that FCC can exploit by offering **training for NGO's +  tech support**. The idea would be to bring clients and (future) service providers to the same market place and grow together.
  * I can guarantee that, given the nature of FCC there are a lot of campers with nonprofit orientation.

* Interestingly, one issue is *security and privacy*. I would suggest to check how [Tactical Tech](https://tacticaltech.org/) is approaching this issue (mostly through activism).

* See that there is an opportunity for the FCC project to explore an approach that many nonprofit understand better: making courses that looks more *social, not technical* oriented. 

* I would also suggest to develop a parallel project to offer FRONT-END services in mass instead of per project, like an *AGENCY*: front-end needs are so common for an issue to be dismissed, the market really exists and FCC students are more into it...

* In the customisation, think how to STANDARDISE. *Modularisation* could be a good idea. FCC can offer modular, even turn-key services to organisations instead of only customised Professional Services. A good market research is required..."

##Automatic Summarization Project for Chatrooms and Forum

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization

I think I will continue working on this topic. In general there are few good API's for that, but I wonder if we can develop something that suits the FCC case?

You can take for example an URL of a discussion in the Forum (NOTE: it will be truncated!) and use the following API:
https://www.tools4noobs.com/summarize/

I also tried some clustered texts from a previous project that involved communications in this room. You can pick a group of posts at the end of the following notebook:
https://github.com/evaristoc/fccgitterDataScience/blob/master/Identifying%20Relevant%20Topics%20in%20a%20Chatroom.ipynb

And use the aforementioned API to see how the API summarizes the content of the posts.

The Automatic Summarization project is currently experimental. The actual added value and therefore the opportunities and adoption of this kind of approach are still to be seen but FCC could, for example, present summaries of the weekly content of the main chats/forums in a more comprehensive way that just listing popular questions, or add summary capabilities so a person can get a general approximation of the main arguments in a on-going discussion.

My assumption is that this could help to facilitate the readability of the communications, ease the search behaviour about topics of interests, and increase **conversion and engagement**. However I need to investigate if those benefits have been true for other situations when a summarizing tool has been used."

With regards to the Code Grants, what we're doing aligns more with the free software movement than it does the open source initiative. A good amount of what we do for nonprofits is not open source, although in the future this ratio could change.

##Today in a Data Science meetup: PyData (Amsterdam)
https://www.meetup.com/PyData-NL/events/232899698/

Main topics:
* **Deep Learning (convolutional NN) applied in Natural Language Processing** for sentiment analysis and topic extraction:
  * Excellent exercise showing the power and the limitations of this approach
  * Advices are if using convolutional, you will think about ignoring the position of the word in the text (which is less important for image ML) and it should be more GPU rather than CPU based; if you want to go NN, think about recurrent networks instead, but otherwise go TFIDF - SVM or just use Google suite, with a recently launched summarising tool...
* **Individual vs Company name recognition**:
  * Focus of the project on a system to easily distinguishing individuals from companies in datasets coming from different sources where the only primary key possible is the name of the person of the company; also used as a lookup tool...
  * Useful project for easing the identification of 
  * Final best result consisting of few thumb of rule steps to clear the data before passing the remaining data through a assemble of a simple NN + logistic regression.
  * Nice project with a demo at place that showed to be very effective."

I think NPTFG would like to focus on consultancy on social media for NGO's/nonprofit?

Not a benchmark for the FCC project as FCC interest is totally different...

And here an example of why the sampling design aspect is relevant, @CodeNonprofit: 

One serious problem of the NPTFG survey is that **many people in the same organisation can answer the survey**. That is a situation that will pose serious challenges in the analysis. If there are many respondents from the same organisation answering the survey, which one should I take? Worst: what if the information given by several of them disagree? Better to have only one that you DON'T know if wrong but you can assume it is ok, than having several of them and not knowing what to choose!!!

Therefore data per organisation is better to be UNIQUE to avoid discrepancies: ONE organisation, ONE questionnaire only."

But I do think it's worth knowing what's out there and wording things in the same way unless there is a reason not to. I think the vast majority of their survey won't align but they've been running and refining their survey for years so could have good questions. It always takes time and testing to get survey questions right and any change from year to year reduces your ability to see trends so if we can get it closer the first time we'll be ahead. I've reached out to them to try and get a copy of their questions but have no expectation that they will be used.

**About asking questions**:
I think the idea of benchmarking with other questionnaires as suggested by @krisgesling and supported by me is not a suggestion to make the same questionnaire but more about adapting to this survey needs. Additionally, for some analyses to make sense you might find yourself having to make similar questions in some cases, like standard/required questions.

I think it is a good practice to see what others have done after all.

**About focusing**:
:+1: !

**About techsoup**:
Interesting...

**Abouth NPTFG**:
I can give or take any opinion about it as I don't know.

**About FCC final product not being websites**:
:+1: . That is a good point that will guide the kind of questions you want to respond !

**Right survey-takers**:
Yes, I can understand. Another solution could be to post the right questions so we could be sure that the person will answer if he/she is the most qualified one. Question Form could be important. NOT sure about it though... Probably better direct questions...

> to who the NGO's will trust their technological requirements?

The first answer is: IT DEPENDS... But it is indeed one of the battle grounds of the technological offers around there right now. Google, by the way, it is doing something similar as MS: donating part of the services to NGO's.

Another nontrivial aspect when working with NGO's is that NOT ALL of them focus on Technology: they usually offer social services in geographical areas where technology is, to the surprise of many of us, very much delayed, controlled or unexistent, or where direct social activism is perceived as more important than technological status. The budget for technological updates could be constrained in many cases. I think @krisgesling can comment on that much better than me right now. I also have been related to the NGO sector in the past and recognised the technology gap/delay between countries.

Some NGO's are trying to reduce that gap and that is the area where FCC can help the most right now. FCC and @CodeNonprofit are making a very nice effort to find those organisations that can benefit from IT technical service, which is great. In fact, FCC is helping to reduce the gap for those who want learning to program.

One question for organisations like FCC or infoxchange.org seems to be: 
> what the factors are that are driving adoption of different technologies, and how FCC can help to improve/accelerate the adoption and maintenance?"

@Alaa-Sabbagh

You listed a number of questions you want to know:

> Why we want to know: ...

You have several questions for the survey? That can generate conflicts in the questionnaire design that not a single person could answer but several in the same organisation.

There are some learnings from the New Coder Survey 2016 that could be taken in consideration. @erictleung was working on a post-evaluation of the New Coder Survey. @SamAI-Software was also expressing his ideas.

This project is different because it is a survey on ""organisations"", not users, so it is different. Specifically, they are NGO's.  

@CodeNonprofit charitable organisations could be synonym of SPONSORSHIP. Some organisations make arrangements with other organisations that would supply them the technology they use.

Other thing to take in account is WHO should answer this questionnaire? An existing Subject Matter Expert or Technology Specialist, or the CEO? Be aware that you might not be totally in control of this in a self-administered questionnaire, but do all what you can to send the survey to the target person. According to the competencies and roles of the person you might have to deal with how  reliable some answers are, so design your survey accordingly.

The other question is how and who organise the volunteering work regarding technology IF ANY? Think that the organisation might have a volunteering programme but not on the technology aspects, for example, for being critical. So it is more about how they maintain/update the existing technological infrastructure?

I would add proper questions about technological vs budget concerns that will allows them to maintain/improve their position.

@krisgesling how can we get a copy of the survey you are mentioning?

---

Also important:
* Whenever possible, keep it short. OBS: short doesn't mean length: it means time required to answer, so it is more about HOW EASY is to answer it
* Whenever possible, give the user the selections (I mean ALL the possible selections) => avoid user inputs unless it is something you really want to know from the user; but be aware that user input is REALLY REALLY prone to generate discrepancies and render the answer or even the conclusions useless
* Whenever possible, standardise the responses, so the analyst won't have to deal with disparities; use existing standards whenever possible, as long as they are part of the JARGON or easy to understand by your target respondent
* Plan ahead the study: is a one-time cross-sectional? or is this a yearly project? If the project is planned to be done every year and you want to compare them, then think about how comparable your results would be so consistency is a must
* Sampling Design: this is an **important issue** that could seriously affect your conclusions: if you are unable to make a good sampling design your final conclusions might be incorrect;  however, making a good sampling could be costly; better to have the support of someone who can tell you what you *really* can conclude from the resulting fieldwork and what not"

Free Code Camp will soon be running a Nonprofit Technology survey, to be released as open data. Would you be interested in offering help and feedback in designing the survey? Most specifically, how to ask the questions without introducing bias, and to result in the most analysis-prone data possible. 

Here's a small explanation of where we are:

What we want to know:

- do they work for a registered 501(c)(3) charitable organization?
- does their organization have a budget specifically for technology?
- what types of software do they spend money on?
- is there an existing software solution for their use case?
- do they make use of free solutions?
- who in the organization is deciding what software to use?
- how long have they used their current solution?
- how satisfied are they with their current software solution?
- how can we best spend our volunteer efforts on nonprofits?

Why we want to know:

- We’re curious where nonprofits are overpaying for technology the most
- We want to allocate our scarce resources (volunteers) carefully
- We want nonprofits to understand, through our open data results, how other organizations are using technology
- We want nonprofits to learn about off the shelf solutions, but also that custom code is a thing"

##For those taking the Spark Course, Data Analysis

I just finished the videos of this week. It is my guess that the lecturer is suggesting to work with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique. I have used that for comparing and deciding similarities between texts for previous projects here (for text analytics SVD is the most known Latent Semantic Analysis method). SVD is a first elemental choice method for the application the lecturer is suggesting too (recommenders). 
In the last video of this week of the Spark course, the lecturer didn't appear to mention we could be working with SVD: he instead briefly describes the ALGORITHM to make it works. SVD is in any case a matrix transformation, and that is one of the reasons why Spark is much better than Hadoop-based technologies: algorithmically you require some recursive-like behaviour for those transformations which is cumbersome, if not impossible, to implement in Hadoop.
See you around!!"

##What can we expect in the future of the Big Data / Data Science industry?

Having studies in Innovation and Technology Topics this is an interesting topic for me. My question would be:

> What could we expect from the job market of Big Data / Data Science in the future taking in consideration some current trends in the industry?

 No more than 6 years ago I remember a friend who was completing studies to become a Clinical Data Manager (CDM). A CDM is a person who has to follow the collection and transfer of the data for clinical trials from the start to the end of the trial. It is a very specialised job. About 6 years ago the job market was still healthy in Western Europe (there are numerous clinical trials in the continent) and the positions well paid. But suddenly, this friend ended up not finding jobs, and all the positions suddenly disappeared. Why? There was a centralisation of the activities and all the data collected in Europe and around the world for a clinical trial would be managed from a single operator in US, for example.

Boom. No more jobs as CDM and that happened very quickly, just in a period of 2-3 years.

In the Big Data sector the trend is apparently this:
* **Big Data = Big Players: IaaS**. Some companies are investing in the infrastructure required for Big Data and offering the infrastructure in cloud for Big Data warehousing. Amazon, Google, MS, Teradata and IBM are some of the best examples. Clients using those services won't need the engineering for the infrastructure: administrators will come handy enough. Nowadays is becoming really expensive to reach the service scale of the existing big players, becoming the required capital investment a strong barrier of entry.
* **PaaS / SaaS**: On top of that, companies are offering more mechanisms that will make easier to interact with your data using the tools of your preference. Here is a real fierce competition for USERS: getting a critical mass of users will be key to define who becomes the de facto standard, so there is a campaign to let you start using platforms for free. A list of some:
  * IBMl's DataScientistWorkBench and BlueMix (who is very close to corporative market)
  * Google's TensorFlow and Google CloudMachineLearning
  * MS's Azure (also very close to corporative market)
  * Databricks-Spark on Amazon
  * Cloudera-Hadoop ML (originally Yahoo! tech) tools on Amazon (losing terrain to Spark)
  * another simple example of a new entrant: skale.me (tough! only niche for now, and no matter how good the technology skale.me could eventually be left just like concept proposal...)

What that means? It is possible that some leaders in the sector are pushing to centralization. Companies like Teradata, Pentaho, Datos, or DataDriven already offer centralised data analytics services since some time ago. A hardcore indication of this trend comes from companies dedicated to automated online marketing, or those in the stock market sector, offering automated bidding mechanisms. Those bidding mechanisms are not perfect though, but good enough for commodity services.

So questions that you would like to ask yourself now:
* Which technology should I learn first?
* If I get a job, is that position threatened by centralization? (there will be some Merger&Acquisition at some point...)
* If my position is threatened by centralization, how much time do I have before that happens and then what am I gonna do to pay my rent after that!!!????

The point is: this sector as ALL sectors in IT could be changing VERY VERY fast, faster than you think... For what I have seen how companies change, you could expect that:
* Most of the companies delay adoption until technology matures and they are prepared for...
* ... but once that happens, many of those will trend to adopt rather quickly, in few years, in order not to stay behind

So making good selections and planning ahead could be very helpful, I guess..."

As induced by previous data, hackers (the most) and executives are more prone to work remote. Some creative positions also might enjoy that advantage. It appears that the more you get into hard abstract activities, or the more the responsibility is to respond to short calls due to the nature of the job or the more your work has to do with centralised resources, the higher the chance you will have to work in a premise...

At least that could be the current situation...

THE DATA IS NOT NORMALISED... I didn't verify the sample sizes so this is a very quick approximation for now..."

Continuing with the analyses on the StackOverf Survey as suggested by @QuincyLarson: do you really want to work remote? Become a hacker (52% of hackers admitted working remotely). All the rest worked mostly on-place. Do you prefer by all means the security of the premises? Then become a QA specialist or an Embedded Application Developer: you might end between the 81% percent of employers that work on those conditions...

FCC don't collect direct data about country of origin I am afraid... Making an approximation using Google Analytics data it seems that there were less than 200 people from Pakistan during the last 30 days (hope this doesn't discourage you to continue...). Do you have  an idea of the reasons that could explain those low numbers of Pakistani users?

Checking Google Analytics data I also observed a peak in the number of new Pakistani users few days ago. Wondering:

##JUPYTER and Polyglotism

I am using the Jupyter (although not Anaconda yet) platform to code in python, R and now some d3.js to prepare the project suggested by @QuincyLarson, all in the same notebook. Although not the best code ( :( ) I will make part of that notebook available, as an example of how to write in several languages on Jupyter notebook. 

Not sure if a real asset. Polyglot approaches could be also very confusing and likely less efficient that using only one central language. And many languages are incorporating ways to handle other languages and still look like native. A close example is R which has incorporated new libraries to write in d3.js. 

In any case, notice that we are already being polyglots when using the Databricks platform, for those who are following the Spark course. SQL, python, some R for those who want to, and Spark, all on the same interface: Jupyter Notebooks."

However there are countries that for either job culture or infrastructure or other reasons the remote work won't be encouraged and even allowed.

To elaborate better on those trends we could try to analyse the data per country segments. We have some data about country key measures used for an [article I made for medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/english-size-connectivity-and-campsites-factors-driving-the-use-of-free-code-camp-worldwide-3c9d4e2b8c17#.3lc8o64y8) at the beginning of this year.

I will come to you later but so far, when comparing **current salary against working remotely** there are two points at which working remotely seems to occur:
* Apparently very low salary will trend to find jobs remotely more frequently, possibly indicating no benefits and part-time jobs
* Then those who are earning average salary will seldom work remotely; this is a possible indication of critical positions where being close to the source is relevant...
* ... until your salary increase, then, you will trend to work mostly *sometimes* remotely, possibly indicating more mobility for work reasons, or perhaps having the benefit of working from home some days per week

I think we cannot extract from this data *how far* the person work, if that is what interest you: the data only suggests if the person works remotely or not, but not *from where*. We should have to assume things or maybe using other external sources to confirm the findings.

Another aspect that we could try to solve is to which sector the person works. And then country of course. Better to take as reference the most important countries (we could suggest which could be our focus based on GA information, for example) and obtain an accumulative for the rest of the world."

I was wondering whether at some point in your career (years experience) it starts to pay more to work remotely than on-site. If you could figure out the median salary for candidates within specific bands of years of experience, this would help illustrate whether such a phenomenon exists.

##Few Advices from Data Scientists if we are trying exercises
I was in contact with some people at skale.me, privately and publicly; here some suggestions:
* try to put a strong focus on ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) aspects of the job, something that it is not very much considered at the different courses but that it is in fact a very important aspect of the whole (Big) Data analysis (I can say I agree with that claim...)
* we can keep it simple and run everything locally; I would say this is more our decision in case we want to experience with complex settings
* Victor Millan, the person in the skale.me video, got an error when working with Hadoop instantiation in one of the exercises that ended affecting its computer, so we possibly have to be careful with Hadoop!!"

As I said, they are not giving any substantial content for Machine Learning / Statistics, although you can progress through without: the exercises are sometimes self-explained and copy/paste could be enough to complete them...

I'll admit it is vague but it at least gets you to doing things and then you can afterwards focus on interpretation. @evaristoc above has emphasized that data science is about ""how to extract relevant information out of [data].""

So I would suggest Kaggle as a place to start because it gives you a data set and at least a question to answer. You can also check out the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) for datasets to mess around with. It is a little less guiding than the Kaggle competitions in terms of what you can ask about the data but some of the datasets, such as the [iris](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) dataset, will tell you what kind of ""associated tasks"" you can perform on the data (for the Iris dataset, it says you can do classification).

All in all,

- choose a programming language (probably R or Python),
- be curious about your data by asking questions, 
- explore potential patterns that may exist in the data, and
- provide ways to present the data."

All that really means, though, is that to get the certificate for the whole series (all courses must be paid for, not the free versions) is slightly more complicated. With exception to the intro to Python and R courses, all the courses I have taken from their curriculum are more lessons in theory than practical application of data science (the hardest thing you have to do in most of them is copy/paste in the correct order), and they focus on using Microsoft tools, including things I have never heard a data scientist list as one of their tools (looking at you, excel...). If you want a very beginner level look at data science it's a good set of courses to start with. Otherwise I'd really only advise someone go through then because they only take a few hours and look good on a resume.

##What to do after the pySpark course or with the skale.me project?
I still think the most interesting project would be that one involving skale.me. You can also make use of pySpark through the Databricks platform: if you are registered you will have access to a cluster and I think 20Gb of space, and there are ways to load data into your account.

If some of us decide to go ahead with more exercises during/after trainings:
* My invitation is still the same: get some data, more specially FCC data, use the tool to transform/analyse the data, and render the results on a webpage. Also the opportunity to prepare a short medium article for FCC is encouraged.
* My suggestion is to make small teams in this group.
* If we follow the route above, it is my impression that we won't be able to make a persistent demo like a heroku website. If that is the case an option could be to work on it locally and to make a short video showing the results.
* The FCC data available is not Big Data but I am sure it could be enough for exercises as it will pose similar challenges than a Big Data dataset. Feel free to go ahead with any other dataset though.
*  REMEMBER: it is ALWAYS not about how big the data is but **how to extract relevant information out of it**. You might end up applying similar methods on Big Data than those ones you apply on small data (eg. regressions, clusters, etc), or just modifications of those techniques to suit larger datasets. Big Data technologies are usually meant to help applying those same techniques easier on Big Data. So no worries if the selected dataset is not Big Data."

##For those who might be interested in practising with skale.me:

People from skale.me answered to a question about requirements:
> Using skale-engine directly with JSON files is totally ok. You can already take advantage of parallelism from one node with multiple CPUs with skale (as opposed to a single nodeJS process), no need to go to a fully distributed system if it's not required by the volume of data or speed of computation.

Installing a parallel functionality could be up to us, just for the sake of also practising with the architecture. I am still seriously thinking about it but we can decide that as a group.

For those who decide to install skale locally, just remember that:

##For all of us taking the trainings in pySpark: general info:

* The courses are hosted by edX as a xSeries in Spark offered by Berkeley University
* There are 3 courses:
  * An Introduction (CS105x)
  * Data Analysis (CS110x)
  * Distributed (CS120x)
* CS105 is still open because was extended until September (@alicejiang1 finished; @darwinrc is still doing it and @Lightwaves and I just started this weekend); the new edition of CS110 starts today (you can register at any time: we are all registering in this one too); CS120 just closed but you can visit the course content and do the exercises although won't be scored (ask @alicejiang1 if you want to know more about it)
* They are teaching pySpark and SQL Spark on the Databricks platform (very nice!)
* Python is a requirement and I would say regex; the training will be easy if you have basic to intermediate knowledge of: 
  * Big Data technologies 
  * python (2.x; specially pandas/matplotlib/numpy libraries will become handy)
  * functional programming (Spark is Scala) and map-reduce
  * regex (you will be using it in several exercises)
 * some basic knowledge of data analysis (I saw some regression analysis, I haven't seen all courses yet)
  * some SQL
* The main focus is on learning to use the tool and its advantages for managing Big Data over things like Hadoop; for ML you should follow other trainings"

##Sharing with you the project for the detection of relevant topics in this chat using python

You can find it at [the github I made for projects in FCC](https://github.com/evaristoc/fccgitterDataScience/blob/master/Identifying%20Relevant%20Topics%20in%20a%20Chatroom.ipynb).

@Lightwaves you were interested in this project?

Some interesting things came out of it, but I think the method as it is now should be tuned for any application in more complex rooms. I think more variables, tuning and possible other methods should be used instead. I am not going to test it soon though...

I always had this idea that Spark was an amazing tool. I have been in contact with the Big Data / Data Science community for a while but my first introduction to Big Data was Hadoop. I was not until a conference about 1.5 year ago about Spark where I met personally Paco Nathan, one of the founders of Spark / Databricks. Really nice guy. He is a real promoter of Open Source and Learning Access for Everyone.

Of all, what surprise me the most is the Databricks Platform. It is amazing that you can do some Big Data / Data Science exercises without troubling much about settings. This people in Berkeley really did an excellent job.

Immediately after that meeting about Spark everyone in the Big Data circles here in Amsterdam were starting to talk about it and never went back. I remember one guy who was a regular attendant to those meetings saying ""Hadoop? Hadoop techs are dead!"". He is a Scala guy who by that time was working for a start-up Big Data company here in Holland making projects in the automobile sector. By that time it was more about electricity use because they were more into electric cars, but I wouldn' t be surprise they are moving into the Internet of Things in that sector...

This will be the first time that I go through it. I am lucky to know SQL (for Hive), python and Hadoop, as well as some idea of distributed/multiprocessing theory and practice: it makes it easier."

##Big Data for the NGO sector and FCC:

(@CodeNonprofit ? @QuincyLarson ? )

I know FCC is an organisation which main objective is providing the minimal but most important requirements to become a webdev. However it seems that with the increasing importance of Big Data technologies the pressure on a webdev to have a minimum Big Data knowledge in his/her *repertoire* could become an asset.

However
> how to connect the FCC main mission (helping NGO's) with the use of Big Data? Are there opportunities where FCC campers could have some exposure to those technologies in the future?

A few weeks ago a friend who works in the Logistics Department of the Dutch office of *Medicins Sans Frontiers* (Doctors Without Borders) confessed me that he was taking a course in Data Science at Coursera. The reason? There is a growing interest in that NGO to incorporate Data Science methods and Big Data technology in their current work flow.

The rationale behind the interest of an organisation like Doctor Without Borders to incorporating Big Data technology is the same as that one of the Red Cross and many other organisations working in the Disaster Management sector: trying to find ways to manage a small staff with few resources to be correctly deployed on critical areas *around the world* responding to *events that are hard to predict* (although, actually, they are becoming more common with the time...).

I was recalling my conversation after finding the following article, dated 2013:
http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/big-data-analytics/how-big-data-changes-the-game-for-non-profits/

Perhaps these are not the best examples for someone who is just starting to learn coding, but I think there will be more interesting cases in the future. Don't think FCC should be working on that necessarily, probably not, but... who knows... :)

* Bear in mind that skale is featured in ES6 and it will be in ES7 soon, so *if you don't have node version 4 or beyond it won't run!*
* For parallelism, skale seems to use a lot of web sockets; for those who have experience with sockets you should already know that *this could be very painful to debug*, so keep it simple... it also involves *some security vulnerabilities* so no for production for now...

Hope we can share some progress together. I hope we will be able to set a simulated distributed system to see how it goes."

I was giving a thought again to the skale.me project, watched the video again and I became more convinced that we we should REALLY do this one. I tell you why I think so:
* nodejs is gaining momentum
* **ES6** and then **ES7** are bringing additional capabilities that although still far from being like any other well established functional programming, it is getting close; functional programming seems to be the paradigm that characterises some important big data tools at the moment
* attending meetings like **nodeschool** I have being said that the role of nodejs is currently for API points; however it seems to start getting deeply into the architecture
* ***VERY Important***: if above is true, then **incorporating tools like skale.me as intermediate data management tool will become a natural step!!!**
* Important: nodejs people are working on **a nodejs certification** in cooperation with **Linux** => getting serious...
* Important: nodejs people are working on **re-organising the npm ecosystem** (this is going to be tough though...) => getting serious...
* Important: aparently organisations like **RedHat** are extensively using nodejs
* companies like **nearForm** (I think related to the skale project) are making a living out of nodejs

I think skale.me won't take off immediately, but I am sure that if the owners of the project are persistent enough skale.me will fill some existing **niches** where scala/spark is too much for a project. If you are a JS/nodejs developer and the company you are working for requires certain level of data manipulation to a level closer to Big Data but without reaching that point (small/medium organisations), the implementation could make more sense than hiring a new sort of developers to do that job. In fact I would even think that an organisation like FCC could benefit from a project like skale.me if implementing a more data-driven approach, just to give you an example of organisation size.

However, if skale goes beyond of being-an-API point, then companies like airlines or banks could be those looking at projects like skale.me.

The only thing that makes me wonder is that skale.me is mostly pointing to a SaaS in cloud. Not sure how to interpret this...

For those more into ML, they are proposing some interesting syntaxes in pure JS. Far from beat other existing ones IMO, but you can always combine them (eg. Spark/python is already a well established project).

I think it is worth trying..."

##Update about the skale.me project
* I have contacted some people in this room that I think would be interested in going through the exercises. Other people have expressed their interest to participate. **So far we are 6-7 people**. There are other 2 pending. We could eventually make small groups, depending on the number of participants and the difficulty of the task. I might need your help with setting up some aspects of the exercise (I still don't know) but wait for updates.
* I contacted the person of the video I mentioned in [a previous message Aug 07 00:22](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=57a66329fb162b752ca43649). He said:
  * skale is too far from being considered as an alternative to spark; so learning skale is not a guarantee for a career in Big Data right now...
  * there are some common places in the syntax/semantic used for Big Data manipulation, so it could be good as an introduction
  * it is good for exercises in Big Data

  For what I have seen, it will be easier to install than Spark (`npm install ...`) BUT the syntax could be a bit tricky if you don't understand parallelism and distributed systems. I know some. The idea is to get into it together.
* The speaker of the video would be sharing his code for the exercise he presented (which he says is also included in the skale.me code). I still think we should try the example I suggested previously at [Aug 08 22:03](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=57a8e57cff82b9fc7e6ca4a4). It is also more ""Free Code Camp"" and will allow some conclusions about Free Code Camp activity. For what I have seen so far, the tool will be enough for the intended analyses. The only thing that I am not still sure about is the setup.

Keep you informed!"

##More about the possible skale.me project

**People at skale.me answered**. The answer was not a direct one so here my interpretation (to be confirmed):

* It should test the purpose of the tool they are building (Big Data manipulation, but also Data Science / ML features)
* Therefore, any exercise should be preferable on HDFS
* For them:
> We see interesting applications not only on datascience, but also in big-data in general, in the form of classical Extract-Transform-Loads (ETLs) jobs to pre-process or post-process various data sources, at whatever volume or complexity.

I am thinking about the following exercise, what do you think?

* taking the historical data from several of our Gitter rooms
* seed each room in a different HDFS node
* run analyses; some that I can think of:
  * SNA tradition
  * analysis of camperbot performance
  * active engagement (simple measure of how long a person devotes to different rooms)

Be aware that *if we use chatroom data*  this is the type of activities I believe we can carry out. **We can still think together about other available data** but it would be important to find a good dataset with interesting applications. **It should also serve FCC too**, if not directly at least profiling the FCC project. Think that it is *an exercise* prepared from the FCC DataScience room after all.

If everything goes fine, we should go from setting up the architecture, through the implementation of the tool until ending with an website that could show certain data upon request. Going from start to end.

It could take the form of a hackathon, if you like.

So... this is my idea. I will keep you informed anyway of the progress!"

##I am consulting with the skale.me project, a Big Data project made in JS, about exercises in Big Data for the DataScience Room

The skale.me project is a relatively new one and seeks to compete in the same terrain as Spark for ML for Distributed Systems. My proposal to them is to find some exercises that could match the level of experience of this group and test the tool, possibly to analyse FCC data.

If I succeed to get some proper advice and possibly involvement by skale.me in the setup of a few exercises, I think the project would benefit several levels of Big Data experience in this room, included some advanced ones.

With that I hope that some of us with limited experience with Big Data could get a first grasp on it, while those who have more experience will be testing a different tool that is essentially based on JS (nodejs) for data analysis of distributed systems.

The possible advantage of both getting involved in this task would be:
* For us, learning/improving Big Data skills in a language where we are already working (JS) + other ones like python or R
* For them, start engaging possible users for their tool
* For both, the possibility to be engaged in a project that could offer a bright future if the idea take off

I hope you like the idea. If so, wish me luck!!!"

Another of my interests have been real time data collection. I got my first introduction to reactive extensions about 2 years ago in a python meetup and I fell in love. Remind you that I am not a programmer, so my love for them has been just platonic, unfortunately...

However, I just recently met Streams in nodejs and started to find nodejs more wow than before. Things start getting clear... *And then* I was revisiting the concepts about reactive extensions just few minutes ago and guess!? Did you know that there is a STRONG relationship between Streams and Reactive Extensions???!!!!

Below a beautiful answer in stackoverflow, explaining the relationship...

This love gets less and less platonic with the time..."

I like the idea of just using that data to make the predictions as they are doing, definitively! Just ignoring the political context here, just the ability to get information about gender, for example, is very interesting...

Yes people, and talking about **BIG DATA**...

I am still in my quest trying to answer what the role that nodejs could be in the future. And even though there are at the moment a few well settled technologies to manipulate big data as fast and furious as possible, like Scala, or other ones that are promising to become the next queen, like erlang-likes, there are those who oppose the views of the skeptist ones who believe that Javascript won't have room in the Big Data circles by wondering: ""*Hey, why not?*"". If not, just check the following video. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsRnmWUjhvY

45min long, showing an unfinished product, and maybe not that entertaining, **BUT** with a brave perspective that could be pioneering a possible breakthrough (you never know...).

Remarks?
* When asked for the advantages of using nodejs and JS instead of Java or any other technology, the speaker responded that one of the simplest advantages is that you won't have to use any intermediate technology to render in JS if required. If JS remains one of the main technologies of the future web (you never know...) well, that minimal advantage could be useful. Did you know that Red Hat was already eliminating many of the intermediate faces to support JS-fullstack? (I didn't either, it is what they said in the video so I can't confirm...).
* **Project to follow...**: a Spark contender: http://skale.me/

The first question is: 

> Is this enough to give an idea of the topic of the conversation?

My selection is biased - I am assuming that the conversation is about a topic of interest (I don't know actually why the first group was apparently mentioning math or statistics as topic, or who did it, etc)

Let's assume however that it is enough and the risk of bias is accepted given the nature of the room...

Now assume that other person, not me, is doing the cleaning and that that person *doesn't know anything* about the content of the communication but have an idea of the topic of the chatroom... Would he/she come with a similar or better ""summary""?

Now assume it is a machine..."

If you can clean the words as much as possible, even if with false positives, but add a well selected post that clearly speak about the topic of a conversation AND add some stats, you can make a contribution to improve the versatility of the chat communication to users, if the chat has at least a mid-level of traffic."

I was also to share this one:

I will read that one, although for the project I am preparing *I think* I found something that is enough to detect the main topic of the week, based on a previous code that I had. If everything is ok, I **won't be able** to pick every single conversation make a description of the conversation like for example:
> X said this. Then Y replied suggesting this. Then X was asking about that...

**However** I think it will be possible to detect *fragments* of conversations (my disentangling is fragmenting conversations between different clusters :(), pick a one of those fragments that looks more relevant than any other fragment, and make a summary like for example:
> X and Y were talking about a, b, c, and d.

Where 'a, b, c and d' could be relevant words to the topic of the room."

Of course! Your jibberish is always welcome! :)

Agree, this is what the clustering should detect; I later tell you something I just found... ;)


> So say Important person x uses some words

Yes... and no. The focus here would be in principle detect the conversation. If everyone is referring to similar objects and content, they *could* be using similar words, unless the content is intrinsically known from previous contacts. It is expected that we are referring to conversations where no pre-determined content has been communicated.
Additionally, an important person could be communicating something important within a conversation without using the relevant words but which meaning is implicitly understood. Think of the Dalai Lama joining the DSR, for example. His message might be relevant, even if out-of-context. Now suppose everyone start talking to the Dalai Lama... is it relevant the conversation? Or should be consider that a trivial one as a topic for the room, for example? How can my machine recognise that that is the Dalai Lama and that the conversation is NOT trivial? This is why ""relevance"" is so hard to get... at the end, I think you have to simply decide what is relevant arbitrarily or based on main topics...


> You'd also be able to take into account other important people to the group make the weight of the words larger if they match other important people.

Excellent point! If that its jibberish, then I don't know how it goes when you talk seriously!! :)

###People:
(@Lightwaves...)
About something that I found:
* Adding the timestamp (standardised) of the post as additional variable for the clustering procedure seems to improve the clustering. Why? In our case, conversations usually occur in relatively close time. Neither long periods to wait an answer nor substantial overlapping are the norm in this chatroom. That regularity in time helps in disentangling a couple of conversations that occurred relatively close in time when their content showed to be different (Nice...!).

I guess other variables should be added in order to disentangle conversations like in the main chatroom where the overlapping is almost unbearable, but let's see...

About the relevance... nope. I mean: I have the idea of what affects it, but creating a code that ""learn"" about how to determine the relevance, no yet... I think it requires more than just neural networks, and I don't have annotated data (again!) so it is hard... I am trying unsupervised methods at the moment but they are not really aware of the dynamic of a dialogue (for example speech order in the conversation): only structure.

I was until today doing a small practice about how to make summaries of contents in chatrooms. My target has been this room, the DSR. For that I have been using:
* tfidf
* lsa
* clustering (k-means, minibatches)

The cluster was looking to separate the posts using the tfidf values of the words in each posts. The assumption was that the tfidf, after a few standardadisation steps, was enough to determine the relevance of the content when using an additional related corpus as main entry. Some other projects out there use tfidf as a relevance measure too (eg. search engines).

I am arriving to similar conclusions when I was exploring an automated system to detect questions in the chat, with some other important findings. Summarising:
* the clustering is helping but not much to the disentangling (separation) of the conversations: I am doing a first clustering over the whole data of **one week** where the clusters trended to overlap a lot... this overlap was slightly reduced when observing the points of the clusters but per day; however there were situations where the overlap didn't disappear.
* there is a lot of overlapping because the content of the posts is not homogeneous in terms of topic.
* also important, the level of English is different per person, even if native speaker; this would affect the homogeneity of the content and make difficult for any rating based on words to determine its relevance.
* then there is the question of relevance: I am using a simple rating that looks for past used words and try to find new ones... this is not enough. Relevance of content could be actually based on:
  * who speaks - the ranking of the person who posts would determine the relevance of the content; keep in mind that the English of that person might be expressively poor BUT the fact that the person is important already determines also the importance of what it is being said/written
  * what it is relevant for the group - just popularity of the post is not enough, and that is even difficult to measure... but determining the relevance to the group is perhaps something that should be done arbitrarily (eg. assigning more weight to words that are considered relevant to that particular group)

This project as it is can help to approximate some summaries but still require intervention. If I find something more interesting I let you know!

Take care!"

Second problem: I am afraid you have to iterate, specially if the lengths are different between rows. Suggestion? First thing that comes to my mind is the `apply` method in pandas? It will iterate inefficiently. I think you can get a better result by considering it as a numpy problem and vectorise but I am not sure..."

I processed some data about main chatroom's posts during the period between Dec 31 2014 midnight until Jun 30 2016 midnight (8Gb) - European Time Zone. Data excluded camperbot. 

The data processing resulted in a json file of 27Mb. The processing consisted in the following:

I divided the data in time windows of 6 hours and aggregated the number of posts that each camper sent during each time window. We have now 2069 points of data between the start and final data collection period, with exceptional cases where NO conversations occurred (eg. the interlude when FCC was using Slack). The idea I have in mind is:
* A billboard of the 5-10 top participants every 6 hours, moving from start to final data collection date.
* Add another chart under the billboard representing the number of participants and/or posts along the period highlighting the specific window we would be observing on the billboard at any specific moment.
* Better if we add a brush to select specific periods of interest?

There is additional data added to the file, like small avatars and counts of readBy's per post. Let me know when we can discuss the file and the viz? I will send you the file when we think we are ready?"

Talking again about the objective of the pilot report for medium. The idea could talk about **how the data shows the importance and the level of the social dynamic in FCC**.
Example:
> No other gitter chat room has had this level of interaction: reaching levels of 7-9 messages per minute!!!
> No other gitter chat room has that level of new comers per minute!
> The increasing activity of the Facebook groups is wow!
> The number of loyal people to FCC social media platforms could be amazing!

@krisgesling man: you don't have to thank me! FCC should THANK you for all your effort!
@SamAI-Software: EXCELLENT JOB!!!! You have really make a VERY GOOD EFFORT!!! Asking you: whenever possible, if you can add my project to your [list of other projects analysing the data](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey#analysis-of-this-data), I will *really appreciate that*! Some observations are welcome (either I hope not to make a lot of changes, no much time, so please if we can consider the project just a demo that will be very appreciated!)

---

###People:
##Planning a summary of the DSR projects focused on social media.

The idea would be to prepare a compilation of the projects around FCC done during the last months and prepare a short medium article, just as a demonstration. Currently projects done are:
* **Facebook**: @samosale's three.js project, @alicejiang1's map, and my data
* **chatroom**: it is where more data exists; @koustuvsinha's chatroom activity and I will work for some data for @samosale to prepare a dynamic ranking (sorry @samosale: I was thinking what to do but now I think I found how! it is going to be nice!)
* **twitter**: just checking; managed to prepare a script to extract data from twitter based on a hack of Mining the Social Web; hard!... and it could be A LOT of data so I have to select some... plan? some stats plus a cloud of the connectivity between friends and followers; it could be big so may not be using d3.js for this one... WHO WANT TO HELP?
* **forum**: some few stats about it using google analytics? not sure about that...

We won't have any info about reddit or medium, although we can use the stats that @QuincyLarson published here?

Something left? I will absent preparing all the data, it is taking a lot of effort to validate the info, etc... It will be a summary of the activities of this group, so nice!"

I think being able to thank someone is as much (if not moreso) for the person showing gratitude - much in the same way that an apology made is often more healing for the soul who's body made it. As much as it feels good to give praise & thanks - or release a conscience ridden with a heavy burden - it's kind to consider the receiver.

It's a good gamification system for new users,  pushes them to study harder and to be more active in chat (join the community).
However, it would be great to have a disable checkbox, coz it's very annoying after a few months. Btw, it doesn't send brownies for ""thz"", so you can use it, but some ppl might think that u are snob :)"

* We have a list of 1501 campsites to date
* One campsite doesn't have a city and therefore there are not coordinates (city = specific name)
* There are also about 10 duplicate records, suggesting that the number of campsites could be actually around 1490
* From those, 505 are campsites of less than 10 people; FB doesn't provide info about groups of that size when searched using the Group extension
* Therefore we could get complete data for about 990 campsites
* The average size is 107 members; however the median (a better estimate for this case) was 36, indicating a large number of small sized campsites and a few with a very large amount of members
* It is possible that the largest number of members reached about 2459 for one location (currently we are investigating which one, but it seems the Local Leaders Group); other groups with high membership (more than 1000) are: London, Delhi, Atlanta, Chicago, Seattle, Bengaluru, San Francisco, New York City or Toronto
* For those campsites we got data, the oldest date at which someone updated the page was 2015-06-28, while the most recent updated campsite was just yesterday (when the analysis was done)
* Around 600-700 campsites out of 990 might have updated their pages between the 15th of the last month and yesterday; the rest seemed to be spread between 2015-06-28 and 2016-06-14 (results still not clear...)"

I solved, @samosale:
* to trigger the function in node, I called from an endpoint (/googlelists)
* I had a function that closed the request at the end of a long cycle; meanwhile the browser was waiting
* didn't know that the browser if not receiving any confirmation before certain time would ping the server automatically and if not response after the ping, it would close with a ""no response""
* the problem was the ping: it was a SECOND request that mounted on top of the first request, duplicating the calls to FB
* solution: use only one request and close the request immediately, no point to let the browser hanging waiting for a response from server: the server would find the data anyway and save it into a file
* after that, a problem with Exceding the limits of request to FB is also apparently gone"

R has a longer learning curve for the language but if you know statistics it will be more productive; python is the other way around: it might looks easy at first, but if you are not confident with statistics you would find harder to use it for statistical analyses...

I managed to update 600 records and added a list of `events` (which would include past events too...).

I am still running into some trouble with fb. One thing that I just discovered is that after making the request through my Firefox to the update page, it goes about 30 seconds not having receiving notification while node is still downloading data, and then Firefox *ping* my server for a second answer before accepting a no response. Although that doesn't prevent node to continue searching, the ping start *a new search* which duplicate the number of requests on fb and therefore exhausting my rate limit. @samosale: any idea how to control for the browser not to ping the server?

However I at least made a **d3 map** plotting the migration path of the species under concern - after going through a lot of debugging and computer crashing, of course...

We lost to very good teams and individuals (actually, I think we lost to everyone...): the winners presented even a simulation in GoogleEarths and had something already prepared for the hackathon; someone made a model of speed of movement of the different species; there was another team presenting relevant data about daily activity of some other species; but perhaps the best one in my opinion was someone presenting a predictive model of positioning (which was very much of interest for the hackathon objective).

The good news is that without knowing d3, I wouldn't have been able to make even a small programatic contribution that afternoon ( I help mostly discussing the results). Considering that I came ill-prepared to the hackathon, that is not too bad..."

Just letting you know how I calculated it:
* the call rate is 600 calls fitting 600 secs (eg if you made 600 calls in 1 sec you will have to wait other 600 secs to restore the limit to other new 600 calls)
* About 30% of the calls I am doing per site consists in 1 call (return ""no data""); the rest is about 5 calls
* thus of the 600 calls limit, 84 are 1-call; the rest 516 are 5 calls
* that means that we have about 103 sites that required 5 calls
* we can solve 187 sites in the 600secs limit
* 600/187 ~ 3.2 sec per call
* I have 2 hours (7200 secs) to solve 1500 sites that can be only solved in 3.2 secs each. You can from here get how much time in total I could approximately require...

Awful approximation but this is the only way I had... let's see if works: by the time I started I had less than 1:20 minutes before token expiration for a 3.6 seconds per query.... in fact:
FAILED at the 1044 record and I got blocked for going **too fast**... so we are not going to get all data today... sorry...

I played with it https://ide.c9.io/samosale/scrap-fcc . It is much easier that way... each element in async array is executed after previous one is finished(when done() is called), but you can add setTimeout.

Keeping the challenges of the FB API aside, so far my suggestion for the **Campsite Project** would be:
* keep a file in a single folder inside the app; use that file as dataset instead of a database
* update the dataset weekly; use a cron implementation for that
* report the events that will happen during the following days (use front end to select those per day)
* find ways to purge the dataset, for example: introduce a criterion for ""active/inactive"" campsites or get rid of dates of events that already ocurred"

Mine managed to make 700 iters, max 3 calls each, min 1 (a search and two gets, one for members and one for events). members and events are not searched if no data about the link is found. I think I have to extend that according to the following:
>600 calls in 600 seconds.

I was doing 2000 msec instead of 6000 msec, so that was definitively too fast...

So far I haven't had problems with GoogleMaps call, but I am still taking some precautions by not calling all during tests and I only call for those without coords (320 sites + 5 more since last update)."

@samosale: I think that your setTimeout in your project for cities is incorrectly implemented? I think it should be nested in a function, so it is a closure instead... otherwise it just wait for a second to run ALL the setTimeouts at once (one per iter)."

##Campsite Project Update:
I am exploring the addition of facebook data to the campsite project using the FB API and found things that it would be nice to share with you:
* HARD (all of it: to register, getting a tokken, docs...)
* tokkens are all SHORT LIFE, starting with just 2 hours life-span or just after logging out.
* ... although you can extend the time for a still-valid tokken as well as all of users, max 60 days (expiring after not use during that period OR not renewal)...
* (the extension can be done programmatically at any time BEFORE the expiration date; it **must** be a server call for server apis)
* ... however at least at 2013 (also current documents still read so...) you had to verify that the *value*  of the tokkens was still the same and ship those values to users when pertinent

Possible links to follow if you are interested in interacting with fb api:
* https://developers.facebook.com (the developers page)
* https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/expiration-and-extension (expiration dates and more...)

I did a quick analysis of the reliability of the updated dataset and so far it seems that:
* the list of city/countries grew up to 1495 over 1222 of the original json file by @samosale
* When updated records, 273 of the records were updated coords for new added cities at the wiki list; another 47 were records that didn't have coords defined in the @samosale's json file
* apparently all the new list of 1495 records have coords except one that was originally found in the @samosale's json file (I think it is that one I mentioned to you, @alicejiang1)

Now: I haven't check if the values of updated coordinates in the new file are correct, so I cannot guarantee the reliability of this new dataset yet. BUT at least we have something.

I am adding the python script I used for the analysis to the repo we are creating, @alicejiang1? For you to check. The numbers are just the lengths of the lists I created (operations with those lengths are not included for being trivial).

Now we could start thinking about @samosale's project with fb, check what else we can do with that, and also replace the current existing json file with the new one, likely with more data/info (coordinates + group sizes + ???).

##Update Campsite Project
We managed to make a first draft of a nodejs-based scraper/updater. 

The project compares data that exists in the [**wiki json file**](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/blob/master/Campsites.json) made by samosale and the [**wiki list**](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/LocalGroups-List) that is usually updated by campers.

The objective is *to update the wiki json file with location and OTHER data (stats, coordinates, etc) to be used for viz and similar*. 

A first json with update data can be found at the following GIST: 
[the gist with data](https://gist.github.com/evaristoc/4885ddef6bac68bee28526312d378750)

The Gist consists in a length-1-list: a json with three attributes:
* `changes`: number of possible individual updates (in this case 320)
* `nocoord`: locations not in the current wiki json file but in the wiki list, updated for coords
* `wikij`: updated json file combining the existing wiki json file and the data from the scrap, with coords added when possible

I just found there are several discrepancies between the two lists (ie. json file and wiki list):
* the json file has 1222 locations (I think all with coords)
* the lists has 1477 locations reported

I expected to complete the wiki json file with the difference between those two (i.e. 255 locations). 

However, it appears that there are *locations in the wiki json file that are not in the wiki list*: the updated json file (`wikij`) is **1495 long**, so the final difference should have been 273. Furthermore, after merging both lists and obtaining 1495 locations, there were apparently still *320 locations* without coordinates. I still don't know the reason of that discrepancy (could be several ones).

In the future, it is expected that, ideally:
```
wiki json file length = wiki list of locations
```

For now the `nocoord` list can be used to adjust the updated json file (`wikij`) by comparing results, because `nocoord` list is a direct reference to the second and it also includes its positional index as so: `[{location_object}, index_in_wikij]`. Example:
```
//the first entry location in `nocoord` (`nocoord[0]`)
var loc = [{""city"":""Bahía Blanca"",""country"":""Argentina"",""facebook"":""https://www.facebook.com/groups/freecodecampbahiablanca/"",""coords"":{""lat"":-38.7183177,""lng"":-62.2663478}}, 6]

//loc[0] is location
//loc[1] is its original position in the final `wikij` wiki json file 

```

Finally, possible advances and remaining work:
* **Dataset to be used for viz** should be that one in FCC/wiki/Campsites.json that should be updated now and then
* **Add and/or improve the viz** by @samosale and @alicejiang1
* Suggest ways to **solve discrepancies between files** so wiki list = json file after updates
* Improve code/data:
 * I ended up using **callback hell**; I tried to use async library without success (it would be great to have it); also all callbacks ended in **one single module** (`compare` at `googlemaps_model`): it would be great to get it more modular...
 * Make the updated file in a selected directory using fs
 * **Add facebook stats?** samosale already made a simple code that can be forked, and even more fb queries could be tested...

###If anyone can help with? Even some advice of how to proceed will be appreciated..."

A quick update of the
##Campsite Project
@alicejiang1 and me haven't finished with the project and might take some time before we finish (no hurry...) but for those who are interested in a simple quick-and-dirty project to update coordinates when having city and country using **GoogleMaps** and **node.js**, you could start checking the project at:
https://github.com/evaristoc/FccCityScraper/tree/development

The project:
* Takes a json file (FCC wiki) of reported existing campsites including city and country names
* Makes a quick selection of those campsites for which the attribute `coords` is not set
* Takes only those listed as incomplete and search for full data using GoogleMaps, by implementing the most simple request to take care of the minimum conditions for the use of GoogleMaps API
* console.log the results

The project could:
* make an updated json file of cities and countries for uploading back to the FCC wiki
* make also an API to show the updated list of cities/countries
* in the future, also call the facebook graph API in order to complete data about campsite groups size (some work already done by @samosale)
* end with a visualization, as that one prepared by @samosale plus some few statistics"

Final sketch of a personal project about **Endangered Amphibia (frogs, toads, salamanders and caecilians (footless amphibia))**:
http://evaristoc.github.io/viz_exer/endangered_amphibia/#

Amphibia is a class composed by 3 orders:
* Anura (frogs, toads)
* Caudata (salamanders)
* Gymnophiona (caecilians or footless Amphibia)  

I have previously did some work for organisations in areas of (species) conservation and environment. There my interest in the status of some species.

After this work I learnt few things

###*Did you know that...?*:

* Since about 20 years the Amphibia class is facing a dramatic decline in species? The phenomenon is known as the [Amphibia Decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_in_amphibian_populations) that has been suggested as a sign of **mass extinction** of the existing Amphibia
* From the 3 orders, Caudata (salamanders) it is the most threatened in general, Gymnophiona is currently the less known
* However, it is in the largest group (Anura) where the most of the species are known to be disappearing. A remarkable case is a group (*genus*) called *Pseudophilautus sp.*, an indigenous group that only exists in remote areas of India and Bangladesh: about 19 species of this genus are currently believed extinct and 40 endangered out of a group of 85 species; another Anura genus in danger is *Atelopus sp.*; of course, they are not the only ones....

There are more things I have learned from this project... I hope you find it interesting..."

Once you're comfortable on implementing a particular statistical test, you can then dig deeper into more technical documentation on what the statistical tests are doing.

A huge thanks to @SamAI-Software who styled and implemented dozens of bar charts, @erictleung who helped clean the dataset, and @sarony who built the website itself, as well as @evaristoc for his leadership of the data science team, and everyone else who has been involved in this massive undertaking.

Many of you have already started working on a visualization. Well, now is the time to finish it if you want it in the first release and initial publicity of these results. Here are the open issues regarding visualizations we'd like to see: https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/issues

Tech Crunch and other publications have already written about our effort, and Kaggle and other repositories of open data are now hosting our dataset. This is the final stretch: publicly releasing the results! Thank you in advance for your big final push to maximize the impact of these data and our presentation of them."

###The DSR Weekly Digest:

[Previous Digest](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=575dd87e2eaa837d71e8d478)

This week was more about the **campsite data analysis** that was started by @samosale and it is been extended by @alicejiang1 and me. The project has received special interest from those working on the coordination of campsites. Other popular posts of this week included topics like:
* Ekman's work in emotion recognition and its application in Data Science; evidence of jobs in Data Science applying Ekman's method
* campers asking and suggesting data-based API's to work on; some expressed interest on the FCC API; I am enquiring about current status and possible future plans for FCC's API
*  scraping with python: BeautifulSoup
* *Data Science jobs in activa and twitch.tv*

Also:
* short discussion about Scala in FCC?

https://github.com/evaristoc/FccCityScraper/tree/development

I think it could work... To be rigorous we should try to deliver the last update of FCC wiki file as a service (something that should be called only once...)... I think I have an idea how to do that in pure nodejs but I don't know if it is worthy...
The most difficult part is downloading data from GoogleMaps:
* we need to call the file at the wiki and iterate through it
* if a city has complete data, skip it
* otherwise it should try to fill in with data

It sounds easy but:
* you need a token from Google Map API (I registered my API and got a tokken; sorry: not sharing)
* the calls are async
* we can make only 10 calls per sec, although we can make 1500 calls per day with the current API tokken
* adding actions to cope with failures is not straightforward
* it is nodejs... not easy horse...

But anyway: we have a sketch..."

In theory:
* We should avoid using a external reference to get at least the coordinates (possibly using GoogleMaps)
* We should try to resource for an (semi)automatic update of the wiki page
* We should add to that wiki page additional records like number of members and possibly population size
* Those data could be used by current @samosale viz, instead of his current preference for a local json"

This is a summary of some of the initial topics we were initially discussing about the project on this channel, with some references:
* @samosale [project kick-off](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56bd8451fa79226456f9e0a2)
* beginning of a comm with @SaintPeter who finally suggested to [write to json the last file](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56bd8a6f7605083b2f067ba0)
* At some point, @samosale said he wrote the writing script but deleted it for not being nice enough...
* coordinates and population were obtained from an [existing file](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56bd8ffc0295dc53403dc104)
* @samosale got [950 cities with coordinates and population, 730 with fb' members](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56bfa28e38f56aa31f39c7ee)
* results at [this repo](https://github.com/samosale/fccCities); in the same repo, a search for [number of membes using facebook](https://github.com/samosale/fccCities/blob/master/index.js)
* results showing in [a viz using three.js](https://github.com/samosale/THREE_JS_GLOBE)
* The current page with coordinates showed in FCC was prepared by @samosale and resides in the [FCC wiki repo](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/blob/master/Campsites.json)"

@Evaderei: what happened at the end with MTSN vagrant? And thanks for those links! I read both... interesting topic, specially the work by SAS (if you didn't know SAS is an statistical package, just like R but close-source, very powerful)."

###The DSR Weekly Digest:

[Previous Digest](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=57546c7f3bdac7ae37b4cdb3)

This week went more over discussing books and ideas, mostly about statistical topics (sorry, @jacobbogers: my claim about ALL statistics found using analytical methods looks indeed an exaggeration, I think what I wanted to say was unclear; my fault...). It seems that we still need some kind of roadmap or curriculum, simple for those who are starting or coming back to the area. Other popular posts of this week included topics like:

* an opinion about where the scientific method applies in ML/DM
* comments about Neo4j and Cypher in relation to a seminar I attended
* @SamAI-Software: a **final draft of his part of the Survey charts** :clap: !!!

In my opinion:
* If you know differential equations, that can help a lot: Statistics has to do a lot with finding optima; all statistics (which is actually referring to the *Measures*) are found from integration and derivation
* Much better if you know algebra as well; LP is a special case of methods to find optima
* The tricky thing in Statistics IMO is actually Probability, and for me the real core of all of it is Combinatronics, but that is way too far probably (although statistical thermo is good example of combinatronics); combinatronics is something that I found missing in most of the courses
* In short, to understand the concepts read combinatronics and probability; to understand how to represent the problem in a way that can be solved read algebra; to understand the solving methods and how to formalise the metrics read algebra (again...), advanced analytical and numerical methods, LP, etc.

I am not an expert though... and I don't know any-one who can help, sorry; but there are curricula everywhere"

Your question is interesting. Just clarifying my view: DM and ML could be easily conceived as branches of statistics, which is the common way of making inference about a hypothesis. DM and ML were developed mostly by engineers, there the apparent differences.

Let's confine the comment to supervised learning.

Then perhaps the main aspect that make them different is that in DM and ML you *use the data to let the best fit model exposed*, while in traditional applications of the scientific method you usually *try to fit an existing model to explain the data* - OBS: not necessarily if Bayesian approach.

Do you see how different is the inference? In the second case, you have made a hypothesis previously to infer on. However in the first case the hypothesis is not explicit: it is a discovery, where the ""exploration"" becomes ""explanation"" and even ""prediction"", mostly when dealing with big data.

However, **there is** inference in ML and DM. Where? *When testing your models*. At that point, you are trying to answer if your model explain the data by making *iterative experiments* that compare different models or just the same model with different parameters, based on statistical argumentation using the scientific method - @bitgrower: here is where knowing the error types come handy... If you know supervised learning, your test dataset contains the control. Your treatment is the model you are iterating. You try your experiments over the validation dataset. Your hypothesis is always:  ""There is no difference between the treatment and the control labels/classes/regression/etc"" but you must have to identify the parameters that validate that hypothesis.

If you already know some statistics and want a simple but common example of what that means, just revise forward- or backward stepwise regression methods."

I'd like to learn but no time and no NVIDIA chips on my computer :cry: I guess no one really knows how to use these new shiny toys :laughing: 

@mosaic-greg in my opinion, the methods in data science are either the same or different, depending on how to look at it. You can employ data science within the scientific method and develop an experiment with large amounts of data. On the other hand, there would be untapped warehouses full of data and instead of having a hypothesis and experiment, it's more of hypothesis and then see if you're wrong or not. The statistical inferences you make on retroactively created data are also weaker. Anyways, those are my two cents :smiley: "

If you know some SQL, Cypher would be familiar to you... I am still a bit surprised about how easy it appeared to be... There should be something else there for sure that they didn't tell us... According to the discussions I heard, the critical point is to formulate the right model that will respond to your questions. The model design is also critical to improve performance, more than size.

The other think you will have to cope with will be Graph Theory. Read the book I suggested, @erictleung! It is good...

If you have time, we could work a few examples using FCC data... This is why I went today, to see if it would work...

We cannot generalise: not everyone MUST use the chat... And measuring that effect without a proper control is tricky, if not impossible.

Still, I have always been interested in evaluating the effect that the FCC resources are having on tenure and performance.

And if possible, to detect aspects that could be improved, in part using results from data."

It might be interesting , if possible, to see the presence of users in multiple chat rooms and to see a drift between the rooms. Do they start in the main room and then drift to other rooms? It would be more difficult to analyze this though...

Just to be clear, when you say main chat room, you mean the chat room named `FreeCodeCamp` right? For coding help from GItHub issues at least, I direct them to the `Help` chat room."

I actually left it like that because I liked the dramatic effect of the strong left-skew. With a log scale that effect would have been lost...

However, not everything that comes from that curve is of concern: One thing I didn't mention is **the long tail of the curve**... So despite of existing an apparently huge drop-out of campers after just few days of joining the main chat (to be confirmed), there is a substantial number of people that have **long tenure**, even up to 600 days!

Additionally, **this trend cannot be extrapolated to other chats**. For example: There are people who could be just using the help chats more than the main and even never using the main, just the help chat only. I think I have seen different drop-out rates in Help chatroom data, don't remember... And even chats like Back End Help will have a different dynamic than Algorithms.

The most important thing here is to ask how to use these results. For example:
> That drop-out from the main chat: what means? Is that having a relationship with the overall retention of new users?

Or better said:
> Is there a causal correlation between permanence in the chatroom and retention in FCC? Is there a correlation between chatroom activity and performance?

If the correlation between retention in chat and FCC is positive, you can suggest that reducing the drop-out in the chatroom will help. So
> how can we reduce the drop-out? Can we identify things that are missing that we can do better in order to extend the stay of new users?

You could make an hypothesis in a form of a question:
> Does the person has enough information about the main chat room when entering for the first time? What is his/her impression? If we clarify the use of the main chatroom in advance, that would help to reduce that drop-out rate or at least improve tenure?

(@erictleung I invite you to check how people get known the main chatroom for the first time, for example; even the camperbot welcome message is uninformative).

There is a lot of progress with Survey 2016 visualizations. Again, @SamAI-Software has been working on it and managed to present a first draft using the @sanori's template. I was trying to embed other visualizations to start testing look-in-field. Other popular posts of this week included topics like:
* A reply from @bitgrower about aspect that could be exploited more in this room, mentioning interest in predictive analytics
* @jacobbogers initiative for a study group using an external forum
* A post about Market Research Forecast for API's

The busy main chat room might not actually be that busy after all...
The large majority of campers that participated in our main chat room between 2015 and 2016 just participated in the chat **just once**. The analysis doesn't show data for those who might been still active in that room (those who will be potentially back). The numbers are still substantial.

How busy is our chat? And what that means for FCC? Is that having an effect on acquisition and retention? Is that counterproductive affecting the performance of those who are using it, or is it actually helping?

And what about other social media and resources that FCC is using? Can FCC do better in optimising the use of its resources in order to benefit even more the campers? Or is it actually having a negative effect?

But one thing is disturbing me - when I hover over Podcasts bars from left to right, I always see flickers because of ""All-Podcasts"".

###People
##Went to a nodeschool meetup yesterday and did you know that...?
It is well known that companies like Uber, Netflix, LinkedIn, or PayPal are using some nodejs for part of their activities.

I met people yesterday working for Airliners and guess: they are also incorporating node in their systems!

The reason? Many companies are currently translating their business logic into API's. And although the languages that manage the logic closer to the databases are still based on other languages, like Java or PHP, the new paradigm consists in using API's as interaction mechanism between users and servers. It is faster, maintainable, maintains a separation between business logic and user requirements, lighter (so it can be made for mobile), between others. 

Still why nodejs if there are other languages, like erlang, that can handle more requests and are more robust? Because it is all JS. That means that one person with knowledge of JS could easily maintain the whole interface. Companies might prefer a not ideal solution but cheaper, as long as the costs of selecting that option are still kept lower than certain ""comfort zone"" threshold.

* I wouldn't insert the labels inside the bars, it is creating an undesired effect for long texts.
* Colouring on hovering: I don't know... I would include that effect for the following two reasons:
 * you want to practice (I am including effects for the same reason...)
 * in the best case scenario, the change of colour is saying ""something else"" (a note, a behaviour, etc).

 In any case, imo the change of colour you implemented might be too strong  (from green to red). Another kind of green would look nicer if you are just only colouring on hovering without any additional behaviour...
* Responsive? Not in my computer, but it could be the **codepen sandbox**. I have not worked on mine recently but I am planning not to present it in codepen because codepen changes the visualization completely. I think we will have a better idea of final look-in-field if we work our projects in github-pages.

@evaristoc, do we have an R room, then ?  That's something I don't seem to have in my universe of educational resources (granted, I haven't pursued it, either...)

Just ask. I suggest to start with the wiki (ask @Rafase282) and then progressively get involved in more difficult tasks where you will need to do a bit more. When actually trying to push a commit you will have to work also at things like, for example:
* Comply with the conventions existing in the repo.
* Install any tool required for that end (linting, ES6, etc).
* Handle the commit in the right manner, and do quality check when required.

@m-henderson by participating in more complex tasks you will get the experience of how teams work on the correct maintenance of development projects, which is part of the curriculum and a requirement for contributing in any existing collective project out there. 

@m-henderson in our case (DSR, Survey 2016) is a bit simpler because we are not asking for commits at the moment, but only to use the dataset for analyses and visualizations.

The repo for the Survey 2016 project is there to check:
* Which viz the people is working on
* Discuss the dataset
* Improve information about the dataset

If you are interested in working on some viz:
* You can clone the repo or just download the clean file
* In both cases, you use a tool to convert the file into a manageable json; we are using R for that at the moment.
* You work on your viz project; codepen is currently for showing drafts when pertinent, for revision purposes.

The final projects will be featured in a website that it is currently under construction by someone at CodeNewbie. I think Quincy will take care of the content."

Clone the fork to your desktop (or whatever). Commit changes to your fork. Then you make a pull request on the original repo and compare it to your changes. Some owner of FCC repo will review your code, maybe ask you to change this and that.  Once your code is good to go, the owner will merge your code into FCC repo and soon you will injected to FCC website.

Like github, the 2016 coder survey repository. So basically you clone that repository on your desktop ( or wherever you see fit) and then let's say you want to ask coders how many family members do you have that also code?. You would basically code that into one of the filwa, commit to your local repo, pull request the actuall repo on FCC github then what happens from there ? When some one accepts your pull request does it automatically inject into FCC website?I'm sorry guys I just want to learn all this stuff so that I can get on you all's level and contribute.

# Advantages of using Free Code Camp

Free Code Camp's main advantages are that we're accessible to busy adults who want to change careers.

Specifically, we're:

- Free
- Self-paced
- Browser-based

One of the most noticeable differences in this curriculum than other Code-Camp/School environments is the level of support: Using the chat-rooms for help, guidance, and assisting fellow coders gives you a better understanding of the code, easier access to explanations, and it's in real-time so you can question the confusion.

##The DSR Weekly Digest:
[Previous Digest](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=57418b6ddce4845b35ec10ad)

More about Survey 2016, specially @SamAI-Software. Also other aspects that were commented:
* Support Vector Machines (@erictleung, @darwinrc) and the MIT course link...
* A mapping library, openlayers (@emilaasa), and the possibility to start a project
* A discussion about the apparent focus on visualizations in this room, waiting for feedback (@jacobbogers, @bitgrower)
* Comments from a Data Science meetup I attended, leading to a proposal to work on a kind of ""Tech Radar""; @koustuvsinha showed interest in participating, possibly to combine with @emilaasa interest?

(trying a different algorithm to analyse the week...)"

The only thing is: I would start by keeping it simple. I was thinking: either a region (possibly at city-level) or at meetup-name level (for which I was thinking nodeschool to start with).

In the second case we can try to focus also on social network analysis (having meetup members as targets), possibly using twitter information, and perhaps geolocation.

The first case (city-level instead) would require more parsing and text mining to identify the meetups that we are interested (remember I suggested to focus on Javascript-related, but that means: react, backbone, angular, etc and won't be easy...). PLUS I would like to combine always that information with social network identification, making it harder...

The fact is that I don't if I have enough time to start working on the hardest idea right from the beginning..."

###By the way...
*Did you know that...?* The most popular trends for meetups, even in SF, is not WEB DEVELOPMENT as it seemed to come out from the last surveys (including stackoverflow...) but **DATA SCIENCE** and **ENTREPRENEURSHIP/BUSINESS**.

It is difficult to say which one is the right trend... I would say both measured different interest group or even different interest from members of an specific group, suggesting biases in both cases... Also, it is about the role of the platform. For example: stackoverflow is a place to talk about ""ISSUES"" with a technology. It is possible that the larger number of questions about JS is because there are more issues with JS than with python? Also, how many people can you expect to ask questions in stackoverflow about distributed programming? This is a elite-kind of question that you ask to someone you know directly. So the bias is huge. Didn't mention that before because unfortunately there was no audience to discuss this topic... But then don't complain when someone try to lie you with ""statistics"".... :)"

Other idea: last Thursday I attended a meetup about Data Science. Some people that I know were working on getting data from meetup.com in order to evaluate the progress of Technology-related meetups in several cities. They are working this project in partnership with a marketing company in order to suggest what they called a ""Technology Radar"".

The scope of their project was broad, so it is very data-intensive (actually, the people I know are part of a Big Data company). I would suggest to peak a topic with a more specific scope, and show a ""Radar"" for that. For example: all meetups related to JavaScript. Or meetups related to Climate Change.

Evaluating the meetup-related activity could give an idea about the intensity at which the topic is gaining the interest of the people who leave at those cities/countries."

##NEW PROJECT? Geo-SPA using openlayers
@emilaasa and me have been discussing a project where we can make good use of the openlayers library. The data should be geo-related and the purpose is to create a sort of API where you can use the front end. @emilaasa suggests a project like this:
> I think an ideal use case for a map based SPA would be something where the user has access to a few data layers, maybe can easily design queries directly from the interface, and get a nice, useful output from the map view. 

We found that FCC might not produce data with those characteristics.

##WE ARE DISCUSSING IDEAS and POSSIBLY ASSEMBLING A SMALL TEAM TO HELP THE PROJECT

OBSERVATION: the project is by @amilaasa: he will reserve the right to accept those proposals or rather going by himself so this is **just for DISCUSSION OF PROPOSALS FIRST**"

Sorry for my late response, since I have been in holidays. I've already finished Andrew Ng's course and totally recommend it, all topics are very thoroughly covered and the exercises are really good to grasp the concepts (and specially being in a such high level language as Octave). Curiously I found an old book (from the 80s) in the library of my University which talks deeply about SVMs and  V. Vapnik and Chervonenkis models. Being a beginner in ML I found it pretty outdated and difficult to follow (it was very mathematical oriented). Blame my ignorance for not appreciating those pioneers, hahaha.

##Those interested in API construction for data analysis, using d3.js
* In my quest to find best ways to build them, it seems that the **reusable chart** is the best option. However it has some limitations that are important to keep in mind. Here a few:
 * http://mim.umd.edu/2015/09/towards-updatable-d3-js-charts/
 
  Also, not everyone is attached to the reusable chart and prefer other strategies. One possible is a **OOP** approach. An example:
 * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16217125/trying-to-generate-bar-chart-in-d3-using-object-oriented-approach 

* I was also looking more info about **d3.js with R** and found a popular library, **shiny**. There are people in this room who already know the library. An example I found from someone in a meetup group I am registered:
 * https://gedemced.shinyapps.io/DP_CATALONIA/

----

I think I have been collecting enough about the basic weapons we could use to prepare a certain kind of ""curriculum for building Data-Driven API's"" for this room. Basically MEAN (with angular2, sorry reacters...) with emphasis on sockets and possible Rx, Flask as alternative, SQL, good jQuery libraries for controllers, a course I found in Numeric Analysis, R, python and d3.js... For now, not Big Data although I am now talking with people of a project called Thunder (python) to see how it goes...

##THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:

**The Survey 2016 dataset is available!!!**

This week we did more work on the Survey 2016 and started working on the final dataset (@erictleung and co.), with reports by @SamAI-Software and me (@evaristoc). Some draft for visualizations in **d3.js** were also discussed. Because the purpose is using d3.js for the project, we were also collecting references about **d3.js**: best practices, usual programming patterns, and examples, just to get inspired.

The analyses of the dataset have been carried out using R, but other tools are welcome.

For those with an interest in Machine Learning, @zcassini and other people have been providing links about free-access books and courses about the topic, and discussed things like Support Vector Machines, kaggle, Multivariate Statistics with some mention of Linear as well as Multilinear Algebra.

If you want to contribute with visualizations about the Survey 2016 dataset, please keep checking the repo and this list:

The only thing is: the 90% of us who participated in kaggle have tried Random Forest without really understanding what other methods can do, or the need of feature creation/transformation. It is essential to investigate more about that and other methods and aspects of the analysis cycle.

Success!"

I didn't know until I saw the video that the first basic problem by Vapnik and Chervonenkis resembled a specific Linear Programming problem with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker constrains.

Check for example: http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes3.pdf

The way that they found the optimising variables (in the dot product), and later discovering that by only translating that dot product into another kernel was enough to to find an optimum for non-linear problems, AND finding that the optimisation function is always convex is just... beautiful.

I really enjoyed the lesson. I hope to have more time to follow more of those ones in the future, really..."

@darwinrc I remember you were taking the Andrew Ng course in ML? He explains SVM in a very straight forward way. Want to get a better idea about the deduction of the SVM then check @erictleung's provided link above (the MIT Lecture by Winston): EX-CE-LLENT!!! 

Furthermore: Are you into mathematical history, and want to know about a contemporary story? Just  a simple anecdote about how long passed before people started taking *seriously* the work by V.

##For those few who might be interested in growing at D3.js...

A couple of links:
* When working on my d3.js viz about the survey data I found an interesting code structure in one of the hacks I was using. I later discovered it is commonly known between d3.js programmers as the **reusable chart** pattern. It is what Mike Bostock (d3.js creator) used for most of the d3.js core code as well as the traditional way to code interconnectivity between charts, although not the only one. Couple of references about the reusable chart pattern:
 * https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/
 * http://www.biovisualize.com/2013/05/d3-meetup-integrating-d3-with-mv.html
* Then I found a really nice and active twitter hashtag to follow some last designs using d3.js: **#d3brokeandmadeart**. Really nice!

Enjoy!"

This is my first draft to show the [results above](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=573da47b0cb634927f805eba), but with **d3.js** and interactively.

I am combining two hacks: one for the dashboard and interaction between charts and the other as an effort to introduce a nice responsive behaviour for the chart.

Believe me when I say that combining two different codes could be challenging, particularly because d3.js was born before the focus on *responsiveness* was around. Additionally, understanding the value passing between functions when interactive programming is not intuitive at all...

 The data is still incorrectly introduced but that is not going to pose a big challenge.

**If anyone think can give me a hand improving the chart's responsive behaviour**, particularly how to implement a responsive behaviour **for the pie** similar to that one I am implementing for the bar chart, **that will be REALLY appreciated...**

* The analysis of this group suggests that those who claimed to know other Podcasts when having few months programming still preferred CodeNewbie as main option barely reporting other not listed podcasts. However, the more the months programming the lesser the prevalence of podcast like CodeNewbie. In particular, the reported ""usefulness"" is more balanced between CodeNewbie, JSJabber and ChangeLog.
* Additionally ""Veterans' taste"" for podcasts seemed to spread between podcasts with a more technical content.
* We cannot argue about the reasons why some of the podcasts were rejected, which could include content or even disliking the presenters.
* OBSERVATION: The question about Podcasts was plagued with biases, so it must be looked at cautiously.

- **Software developers** with **less than 1 year** of experience tend to spend much more time studying programming rather than their experienced colleagues, while for respondents **without software developer's job** it's the opposite - with more experience they tend to spend more hours per week studying.

Taking a look at Advanced R too, @zcassini. I think they are letting out mostly books that are relatively outdated, but even if the versions have been replaced by better ones most of the techniques are still up to date.

@gayathry2612 I did some kaggling before coming to FCC. Really good. If you want to go ML, that is one of the best places indeed. Go to previous challenges and read the fora when public, and even try to solve previous problems even if closed if you have time.

###People:
##Hi New Comers,
We are currently working on data coming from the first **FCC Survey** (15,000 records, 40 questions). Join us! @SamAI-Software is very active in that area and he is organising the info. You can see @SamAI-Software's analyses if you scroll up this page. We are discussing the results and giving tips for our visualizations. Historically we have been using python for the analyses in this room, but for the FCC Survey we are using R (@erictleung's code).

The objective of this exercise is to bring those results as d3.js visualizations. You can see @krisgesling's map for an example. If you don't know d3.js yet, you could at least make some analyses on the data that could be make as viz later on.

The room is open to **all** the topics and discussions even though the focus data is usually FCC data.

I have also prepared a (WIP) page of what has happened in this room since its foundation if you are curious:
http://evaristoc.github.io/FreeCodeCamp_DSR/

Hope you will all enjoy!

I should agree with you that the first one with joint proportions seems to be more informative... a bit more difficult to follow but more informative...)

The second one suggests that:
* There are more students not-SoftDev that are studying, than those who started a job as SoftDev. But this is also clear in the first one...
* The longer the time as not-SoftDev, the more the study dedication time (??? sample size???).
* The more experienced as SoftDev, the more likely you will be dedicating **0 to 10 hours per week** to learning some software. But the second chart is not really giving the right picture, for other comparisons...

(See how the **0 hours** becomes relevant: there were people who answered the survey that were not registered in any training. I would try a break rather closer to 0 instead of ""0-10""; something like ""0-3"" or ""0-5"" hours per week)

The first chart is more informative indeed... I was trying to suggest ways to standardise the data of SoftDev and not-SoftDev so it would be easily comparable (i.e. transform the data so assumes same sample sizes). But might not work...

By the way: who are those you are counting as not-SoftDev? If they are not working as SoftDev, what are they doing that they were answering this questionnaire??"

It would be a column per HoursLearning per softwareYesNo. You have to provide the sub-sample *n* per segment somewhere to indicate that some of them didn't get big samples (eg. softwareYesNo = Yes, time. HoursLearning < 11h). Be aware that that includes those who are not studying... It would be interesting to evaluate those breaks so they are more characteristic: what is the minimal time of HoursLearning so you can say the person is really having time to study? Or better said: is there a characteristic time to indicate that the person is studying one topic per week, several topics per week, or even going to a full time training? However, your breaks are good enough!

Nice work and nice that you are going to work on this with d3!!

About the chart... I cannot really visualize the proportions per category, specially for the least represented category. Could you find a better representation?

I would suggest a similar effect as that one made by @krisgesling:
* the bar chart showing the differences between the TOTALS of each category, not the proportions of ""prefered job"", and including the NA's. The effect of NA per category was easily perceived and probably the most ""shocking"" result in the previous chart.
* add 3 pie charts as companions, each representing the categories you identified and and use them to showing the proportions per segment taking *complete responses only* (not to include NA information).

It would be interesting to find out why the longer time programming the lower the chance that the respondent answered that question... I think it is because they already have a job??

They are only suggestions, @SamAI-Software... No need to implement them.... it would be nice to see it though...

About your previous chart (about working as a software developer): could you just substitute the legend 0-1 by ""No/Yes""? Those results are interesting too..."

This week we continued working on the Survey 2016. @krisgesling made a first final draft of the map for Gender/Ethnicity. Other people in the room showed interest in working some visualizations. @SamAI-Software has been helping to organise the visualizations and hightlighted a few trends from the data. @erictleung is still working a final clean dataset (remember that the current dataset can be used though). @SamAI-Software and me are helping @erictleung with his work. 

For those interested in working on the Survey 2016 dataset, please keep checking the repo and these links:

I've been working as UX designer for a few years and what I've learned during that time is that we should always tell users **a story** from A to Z, step by step, fulfilling their basic need/expectations first and only then taking care of special features.
Your gender [visualization](http://krisgesling.github.io/FCC-Gender-Map/) is **great**! But it doesn't look like a beginning of a journey, does it?

 Just imagine that you land a website of [FCC Survey 2016](coming soon) for the first time and you never saw it before. What do you want to know first? Probably it's something like:
- Where all these respondents come from?
- Is it a survey from USA only?
- Does this survey include ppl from all other the world?
- How many ppl (in percentage terms) are from Europe, Asia, Africa, your own country?

And your [previous version](http://codepen.io/SamAI-Software/pen/zqeBaQ) was very good for that! Of course you will want to know about gender, too, but it's probably the next step.

So anyway we will need to have a country breakdown at least by CountryLive and Age. Somebody can do it from your forks, or you can do it yourself and that would be a great contribution to the project and also you will be featured even more (I'm pretty sure, that @evaristoc will take care of that :+1:  )

If you decide to create it yourself, then I have one cool idea for you! Check out [stackoverflow's survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-geography) the first **Geography** section has a map, but there are also 3 buttons, which can switch 3 different maps! That's a great feature, but a weak implementation, because all their 3 maps looks almost the same.
I suggest us to take this feature, but make a **better** implementation!
You can extent your visualization, so it will show us:
- Amount or respondents (by default)
- Gender (switch with a button)
- Age (switch with a button)

Until you make a decision, I have reserved **Demographics** section for you https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/issues/41

@sarony just showed me the website she's built to host our visualizations, and it looks beautiful. 

We would like to converge on a few key visualizations that we're going to use to illustrate the various relationships in the dataset. 

The map library that @krisgesling used on her visualization looks great - to the extent possible, other map-related info should use the same geo she used for consistency. It would probably be best to fork her Pen and and work from there.

For all the bar charts displayed here (https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-asked-15-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-4104e29b2781#.tvuzyblkg) we will want to create our own D3 versions so we can scale and color them appropriately. Saron and I were thinking for the true/false type questions, we could show a single bar with different colors for yes and no. Would anyone like to design one or find a good one we can use for these? For reference, here's what they look like currently (they're static images):
https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-asked-15-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-4104e29b2781#.tvuzyblkg

@erictleung is still working to clean and combine all the data. In the meantime, most of the basic demographic questions are answered in full on part two of the survey (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey/blob/master/data/2016%20New%20Coders%20Part%202.csv) if you want to focus on building visualizations around that.

Thank you for all your hard work on this. This will most likely be noteworthy (Tech crunch wrote an article teasing this website that we're building around the results) so it should be good professional exposure for all involved, and great practice with manipulating and visualizing data. 

If anyone has questions, you can always contact me or @evaristoc directly, but I urge you to ask here so all can benefit from your question. Happy data time!

You are not adding tool tip information about those... I understand what you are at to but it is not intuitive... it should probably included but as a different statistics. For example:
total interviews: 14k something
complete responses: 13k something (less the no responses)

And then legend about global info.

I think the global info would be much better if you try pie? Could you try a test?"

This is the main focus of the larger discussion on diversity in technology fields - representation of women. So you might consider making a graphic that just shows the percentage of respondents that were female in each country. This means you only have to visualize one thing, and could use intensity of color.

I think the author did a pretty good job in terms of showcasing some common dev related podcasts and some basic tool comparisons. In terms of data viz though, what were you thinking in terms of a project? - 

First thoughts 

1. maybe analyzing other data-points to infer lack of adoption of podcasts?

2. Less of a visualization but more of a keyword aggregator of podcasts (which I suppose one could create linkage and visualization)? 
Ex:
Maybe consume/use some API for podcasts (though it seems it's pretty limited based on cursory google search something like what [this person](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/35ulfv/api_access_to_podcast_feed_dump/)-was looking to do) -
But maybe something like top (n) code related podcasts with matching keyword within episodes to maybe teaching concepts or frameworks/technologies within 
fcc 'stable (e.g., 'react','node', 'mongo', 'callback(s)'? - So, chart plus access ability to go to site and grab podcast? 

Don't know if any of this is close to the initial/spark idea - but what are your thoughts? "

It is also very important for the project that campers show their abilities in manipulating and presenting data as much as using specific tools.

Better d3 as it is part of the FCC program as well as the possibilities that d3.js offers for customisation but I would suggest not prescription as d3 is not easy.

The only issue is project consolidation: if we all start working different technologies that will affect the ways we consolidate the final work which should consist in a small website of visualizations (@QuincyLarson idea). However we could try to deal with that later...

@AyanGhatak let us know about your project!

Your final work looks nicer! I don't still feel that the pie is adding info though...

I can tell you what I see:
1. The usual proportion is 80-85% males over the rest, particularly Asian-European countries
2. That proportion seemed higher in South-America, Africa and some Asian countries; but lower in North American countries, China and some Oceanic countries (Australia, Philippines,...).
3. Ethiopie is an interesting case...
4. There were about xxx amount of countries where there was at least 1 person affirming to belong to non-male/female gender categories.
5. If we exclude countries when no-one reported to belong to non-male/female gender categories, you can notice that that segment reached 1-2% of the total respondents, with some exceptional cases reaching 4-5%.
5. The more respondents, the more likely that the data was better.

Thinking... suppose that you have some data pre-digested as above. Could that work to guide user's information discovery even though it is a bit prescriptive? Let's say as a user I select to check the Affirmation 2: the map could highlight all countries that show over 80% and those which don't. Those countries that are exceptional should be highlighted apart...
The Affirmation 4 or 5 can also allows for highlighting (or opacity...). Etc.

@krisgesling I am just giving you ideas, please be free to select your way according to your interests and possibilities. No pressure! :) "

As you say I previously had the map coloured as a ratio non-men: men however I think it misrepresents the data as countries who only have 2 campers can look like they're leading a progressive revolution. I don't think there's enough data for most countries to make the claims it would be trying to make, even if it looks like a more interesting story. 
Ultimately I was working to address the question of gender breakdown per country for integration into a broader set of visualisations. I haven't thought of a nice way to do that using country fill so for me the pie graph or a stacked bar graph is the best solution."

You might think it contradicts what I advised at [May 03 12:04](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=572877aa72798bd77be97e56) :point_up:. For your first project I had the impression that you wanted to use colours to represent the differences between several different variables at the same time. Blue for countries with the largest amount of males, yellow for intermediate, etc. I might have it wrong.

Still, the fact is that the colour variation make more sense specially if what you want to represent is a *gradient*. A nice example is your most recent map: a colour gradient representing ranges of number of participants.

What your map is probably not showing is *your story*. If what you want to represent is the amount of minorities that participated in the survey, I would suggest *that* as the main colouring aspect of your map. The rest of the information (example how many respondents per country) is possibly marginal.

In my opinion, your story would be more interesting if you not only tell about the proportion of minorities claiming to filling in the questionnaire: it would be great if you can add information about their coding aspirations, resources they use, or perhaps salary expectations.

My personal opinion is that highlighting minorities by excluding majorities is as unfair as the opposite: I would suggest to prepare maps for female, male, or non-(fe)-male alike. An impartial view allows for discussion and observations.

Hope this helps!"

I would keep the map you have done but what about other representation?

Totally agree with  @evaristoc about legend, borders and gender definition. Just wanna add a bit:
There is no need for unnecessary text in tooltip, the information should be easy to consume, so we can drop words like ""respondent"" and sort data descending or just in common order ``male -> female -> other`` to make it easy:
```
- 65% male
- 33% female
- 2% other
```
Then small black legend box will become smaller, so there will be more space for a graph (pie chart).
Also the total amount of respondents for a country should be more noticeable. We can try to duplicate it in the black legend box. Some like this
```
- 65% male
- 33% female
- 2% other
-------------
 6258 total
```

Last approach can look like this:
```
- 65% male (4386)
- 33% female (1752)
- 2% other (120)
-------------

* Can you work a legend for the colours? It is not clear what they mean, I assume it is the number of participants who responded the survey per country.
* Can you try to find a better way to highlight country's borders? White lines are ok for countries in dark green, but for countries in light green the contrast is not enough to distinguish border lines.
* The information in the tooltip: hmmm... the purpose is fine, but a pie without values in it is not informing... probably the font-size is also too big? The tooltip occupies the whole screen, I would feel it better if smaller... and instead of mentioning the whole gender definition for no-male / no-female I would just write ""Other"", so the number of words is less. Be aware that writing the absolute values is ok but they are harder to compare. Usually people make percentage available and the SUBTOTAL counts for back-reference.

Let me know if this helps!"

JSON is NOT a format that it is easily understood by python as it conflicts with a similar data type, **dictionaries**. The json library will parse the JSON document into a dictionary.

Also for you, you could either send your code to me or better asking in python room. I have the impression that you need something similar to `eval`for your case BUT please keep in mind that `eval` shouldn't be used in production otherwise you run the risk of facilitating certain types of malware attacks.

It is strange that the message is embedded in a binary and still being string. Anyway: you can easily parse the binary into a string, I think it is str(msg), I haven't check. Just look for how to get binary into string.

Also let know what library you are using to open the message. If you are not using a known python library specifically for twitter you might find yourself dealing with more low level transformations.

Also if you want to let me know what are you at to? I have been working with python's twitter libraries recently. We could start a project together if you are interested?"

Can you paste a line or two to give us a sense of what it looks like?

@tufonas is the request function from a package? Based on what you've said, I'd look for the tags that the python code is between and then parse that. Can you give us a sample of the HTML you are trying to parse?"

What kind of visualization skills do you have? You can always head to the [GitHub survey repository](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey) and take a look at the questions, initiate conversation on them on what kind of visualizations you think would work, or even ask some questions yourself!

@jboxman best of luck finishing the rest! Looking forward to seeing what kind of visualizations we can make out of the data.

Sorry for the lack of communication lately. I've pushed up my progress to my branch if you want to take a look. The network ID is not actually unique. I have found that you can have duplicate IDs, but the answers are different. So maybe two people used the same computer to finish the survey? I don't think there were a significant number of duplicate so assuming they are separate should be fine.

@erictleung @joeybuczek according to @koustuvsinha the networkID is acting as the primary key between the two files. I haven't check. @joeybuczek the chances that someone skipped the second one highly possible. The chance of duplicate data is also possible. It is likely that the survey will have several discrepancies, we have to try to identify them and at least reduce its impact.
EVERYONE BE AWARE: you have to make conclusion based on the context of how rigorous the fieldwork was. Those who know statistics: you could make observations about the validity of some of the conclusions. I suggest to keep your conclusions within the context in which the data was gathered and be VERY CAREFUL with any generalisation to a larger audience."

@krisgesling thanks! Yes - I am amazed at the geographic diversity of the responses.

@erictleung We shouldn't need two seperate CSV files - we should be able to get everything into one file. Once we've merged everything from part 1 of the survey into part 2, we can probably just delete part 1 and rename part 2. If you can do this once, you will save everyone a ton of trouble down the line.

I just remembered. The second dataset will have the most complete data i.e. those people filled out both parts. The first dataset will have everyone who finished the first part of the survey i.e. this will contain all answers from people independent of whether they finished the second part of the survey.

It's kind of weird. The ""2nd"" part data has all the answers from the first part. If you look at the column names in the second part, there are some that are not in the form of a question e.g. `already_working`. That data will also be in the first part. However, columns in the 2nd part that are in the form of a question e.g. `""What's your gender?""` are exclusively in the 2nd dataset. @evaristoc let me know if my thinking is correct.

# The Java While Loop

The `while` statement evaluates the `expression` (which must return a boolean value), and if it is `true`, the `Statements` get executed.

```java
while (expression)
{
  // Statements
}
```

In the following example, the `expression` is given by `iter_While < 10`. As we increment `iter_While` by `1` each time the loop is executed, the `while` loop will keep going till `iter_While` reaches `10`.

```java
int iter_While = 0;
while (iter_While < 10)
{
    System.out.print (iter_While + "" "");
    // Increment the counter
    // Iterated 10 times, iter_While 0,1,2...9

Perhaps it could work to have the pie graphs included in the mouseover so the user can choose where they investigate. I'll try to get it finished tomorrow. I think it's also worth having an overall look at the global gender numbers.

I wonder if you can add bars or pie charts per country instead of colours? It would be nicer if you do that, and clearer.

If you take the meteor project as template but after calling circles you add an angle layout, you can present those circles as pies. It could be just a modification of the meteor map.

All the meteor map should be kept as it is, only adding to circle the necessary for transforming them into pies.

Other thing: you must find the coordinates of the geographic centres of each country to positioning your pies. I also suggest that the areas of each pie per country should be proportional to the number of users that responded.

At the end, you should clarify what each colour of the pie means (reported gender) AND what the area scale to (ie. how many answers per country).

In my opinion, the MOST INTERESTING THING is not about gender proportion, but about the INCLUSION OF MINORITIES."

If you are at some point involved in a survey project, be aware that this is usually done FIRST, previous to launching. Unfortunately the project had to be launched before.

For the survey dataset @erictleung and me will be working on the dataset using R instead. R is @erictleung's choice as he has more expertise with that language. I can help him as I know R too. I also like R for some stuff...

However, @erictleung code introduced me for the first time to an already old R package, the **dplyr library**, one that improves the management of the R data frames:

I was doing the back end/BASE jumps before many of the current front end projects were added so getti my front end certification is playing catch up! I had some questions about my portfolio site and will on you so as not to fill up this room off topic. Thanks for asking. @evaristoc I out a halt on all my back end projects while I went back to fill in gaps in front end, then life happened. In the past month my grandmother and my step brother both passed away and my parter had 2 serious injuries that were work related. And I've just been trying to take care of myself. Funny how I turn to coding for relaxation. Miss you guys!

**People**: For those who don't know @AdventureBear is a used-to-be well known participant :) (she is almost a FCC founder) and the author of few templates, like the Bootcamp Calculator or the d3.js bar chart viz.

@AdventureBear still, you question is important... we have been working on few things on that regard, but at the moment that part stays experimental. Not so easy as saying ""one-two-three-Done!"". :)

By the way: did you know about the FCC survey (Quincy)? Will you have some time to see if you can contribute with ideas and opinions, if not with a viz?

And how are your personal projects going?? The app for training performance measurement: is that already in the market or are you waiting for ""the right moment""? :)"

Other than that, things are going well. I really enjoyed reading the piece from Josh Ebner on ""the one concept you need to know."" I actually spent a bit of time perusing through a handful of the articles from Sharp Sight Labs. I usually try and stay away from people who promise to show how to do things ""faster..."" although from what I gather the site is trying to encourage persons to learn fundamentals so they don't waste time later due to having skipped concepts... so that's of course good. =)  "

55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2016-05-01T10:24:31.919Z	5586719a15522ed4b3e23add	evaristoc	5725d95f9344bbcb0f8b88ec	@Evaderei my project for this room has always been to encourage working on data-driven projects *where people can contribute at any stage with the best of their skills and interests*. Take this room as an opportunity to build small app's or projects based on data, alone or with other people. If your interest is not DS or data analytics in depth, perhaps trying to build an example of a project based on data analysis, even including better algorithms or technologies to analyse the data, could work for you.
55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2016-05-01T09:57:06.788Z	5586719a15522ed4b3e23add	evaristoc	5725d2f260e2f3e8736666d6	"@Evaderei unless you have a strong interest in information discovery, statistics, algorithms and data engineering, I think it is better not to get into DS in depth. I would suggest you to get an overall idea instead. I found the Howe's course (the WU coursera training you might be following) one of the best in the area, so take it if what you want is just an introduction.

In data science and data analytics you might not be building an app in several jobs, no. You will develop other products, like algorithms to improve the presentation of a recommender or how better clustering the data or doing a better forecast. But think about kaggle or many other cloud SaaS data-driven projects, if that is what you are interested....

However, think that you can get into data analytics at any point of the route. You can always partner with someone else and complement each other. You might, for example, specialise in building data-driven apps without touching the analytical part. It sounds easy, but it is not: you may require certain level of training in terms of UX, API's, etc to make a good project. (this is why I am in FCC by the way...).

But check your goals: If you want examples of what data scientist and data analysts in general could do, just check the tableau public gallery (I have been doing that just few minutes ago...):
https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery

If you don't get excited with what people have been doing in that gallery, or if you don't care about the impact of Tableau as a tool and if kaggle or drivendata don't mean anything to you, if you cannot image yourself building an IoT application, then you should be trying something different."

Working on the FCC curicllum has showed me that I enjoy making things (working on different piece of an app to have all the pieces coalesce and work together at the end feels awesome). I feel as if I get good at data science and work purely in that area, I won't get to work directly on making things (namely, parts that people will see, touch, or notice in a project, an app for example). What would you suggest I do? @evaristoc

""Fun"" in this case is to obtain reliable, meaningful results after you hard work and having a  dataset that allows you to make clear, to-the-point visualizations with easy.

Wrangling is to make the raw dataset accessible to your tools and functionalities, to detect issues that invaliate your analyses, and to facilitate discovery."

We don't have that here. Even simple data, as that one for the Survey require some wrangling.

###For the Survey project we are trying to provide as much as possible pre-processed  data but please fill free to start working on some questions.

@gskoglind agree with @kymanikd: a man with a mission! Hope we can help!

@kymanikd how is the training? I am really interested, I think it makes a good topic to be commented and discussed here...

I had a good conversation with @evaristoc earlier and decided to create this video to summarize our goals for the 2016 Developer Survey results page.
https://youtu.be/f7vO05pqft8

Notes: 
- The GitHub repo: https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/2016-new-coder-survey
- The Stack Overflow survey: http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016
- Our goal: to collaborate on D3 visualizations that answer the 20 specific questions we've asked in GitHub issues by midnight EST May 8
- Then, after we've shipped the website with the 20 D3 visualizations answering our questions, we can consider building additional data tools like a DC.js sandbox."

I have been presenting the DSR Weekly Digest in reddit for a month. The last one included more detailed ""stats"" and it is connected to the DSR webpage.
https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCodeCamp/comments/4ghy4l/fcc_data_science_room_weekly_digest/

Considering the activity in FCC reddit, this last presentation had a better reception by reddit users.

I am going to work on that summary a bit more. I will also probably make a similar summary for other rooms and I will make it available in FCC reddit.

 I will be also working on the DSR webpage. The idea is to use the webpage as a front-end for the room and suggest a permanent ""curriculum"" and a list resources for new comers.

Let's see. Wish me luck!

I gave it a thought and I would vote in favour of going jQuery instead of react. Reasons are:
* At the moment I am the person who apparently has a better knowledge of d3 and I haven't tested that within the react framework yet, so it will be too new to the team; jquery has the advantage that it is easy and accessible to the team.
* Also I am taking in consideration the ""weakest link"": @erictleung is newer than the rest to web development: I think learning well-known libraries will be better for him than get in trouble with difficult stuff.
* Although our task is learning new things, I would prefer to focus on results too. And we will be learning dc.js.

Additionally, I was just having ideas about what and how to represent the data. Here my contribution:
* Focus on the potential main target user: usually people who are interested in web development. So that section should be taking the main viz, while the demographics related to it should take a ""secondary role"". Web Development is the main character, and demographics its attributes.
* We should see if we can group questions in at least three group, each of them with very related questions. Those three groups are like the 3 main areas. The idea is not to represent all the questions in one go.
* The graphs per area should be the main interactive interfaces and should be, let's say, presented in the left side of the screen; in the right side could be the optional graphics about the demographics that the user can select to see (eg. age, gender, etc).
* We should think mobile: it should be at least responsive.

What all of you think?

For example, I feel there should be a README/document describing all the questions that were asked. Secondly, unless I read in the data wrong, some columns are actually part of the same question and the column names should reflect that. For example, there are columns `hackathons`, `conferences`, `NodeSchool` in the first dataset. Without any context, I can't tell what these are saying. But if I remember correctly, they have to do with the question of what other platforms the coder has used before.

I know what to do to make it work, although I haven't practised... we can try but it will be a bit of struggle, unless we find a more suitable visualization library for react...
But I like the idea: probably if we work together? It is more likely we could solve those issues...

You have probably heard @sarony's CodeNewbie podcast or participated in one of her Wednesday night Twitter chats.

She and I have been working closely preparing the 2016 New Coder Survey, and she will be working on many of the assets for the dedicated website, as well as coming up with a lot of questions we can ask of the data.

Please join me in welcoming Saron to our Data Science chat room! "

I have been discussing the auto-generated summary project with other campers who are very active in other rooms and for which I thought a project of this kind could be implemented. 
Here some important considerations:
* DSR is *sui-generis* in the way is managed... most of the current official rooms, but the main one, should be devoted to the curriculum... this is not happening in some rooms like the python, java, etc because there is no curriculum yet. It is possible that a project like above (a semi automated summary) won't make it in those rooms in the future.
* People I consulted coincided that providing links and course information would be valuable. They also coincided in giving information about rooms' activity.
* People I consulted suggested that this type of project should be associated to a camperbot or similar."

I am comparing this data against a (not that good...) control dataset (i.e. another existing room, CodeReview) to identify those words that are common to several rooms for exclusion given that they don't have specific value... The best room to compare though should be data coming from the Main Room.

##About the New Tentative DSR page -->> AutoGenerated Weekly Summary:
I am now **semi-automating the generation** of the the Weekly Update: 
http://evaristoc.github.io/FreeCodeCamp_DSR/update/

The python code for automating the generation of the page is a [gist](https://gist.github.com/evaristoc/c17448266e91b9ee2e54814672ae2aae)

Those who saw the previous draft are going to find some improvements:
* Now I could find a better way to extract the links
* There is also a TRUE word cloud, although requires additional work for properly select relevant words (currently researching the best way...)
* Also: my code is running much faster...

*What's next with this project...?*
An alternative I feel tented to try is to DB and INDEXING THE LINKS, to make a similar project like the one below, but for all links in our room (obs: takes some time to open...):
http://ziplinesfcc.herokuapp.com/

However I have to see if it is still worthy (""ROI"" :) )

##Doing some Data Mining to improve the DataScience Room...

This was the next step I was planning to make: Applying Data Mining techniques over this room...
In the Tentative DSR Website there is now an example of a **Weekly Data Mining over the DSR** as a demo. There I am reporting:
* Main Contributors of the Week
* The Most Popular Post (the most read message)
* A list of links that I managed to extract
* A simple word count with the most popular words

The project will be a bit difficult to implement but I expect to find a way to offer a minimum acceptable product. It is raw but you will certainly get the idea:
http://evaristoc.github.io/FreeCodeCamp_DSR/update/

Also from http://evaristoc.github.io/FreeCodeCamp_DSR/

***Why this project?*** Well: the general idea is simple **Knowledge Management**: here (and in every room at FCC) there is a LOT of information that is going ignored that could be useful for eventual visitors but it is lost in archives. The idea is to rescue part of that information accompanied by clues that provide information about the context under which that information was produced.

In our case we are in a relatively small room and I still feel that it could benefit some users... I think this is a sort of implementation that could make a huge contribution if implemented for rooms like the Main Room, for example..."

I will try to find something... in principle I think we can start by recommending Anaconda... I haven't used it but this is a good point to start... the only problem for me is if the version is NOT using python 3, as I am already 3.5 (3.6 is already available... ufff!!!). Better versions are from 3.4 so far...
I need to check if sk-learn comes with the cannonical exercises installed (eg. iris, engines, titanic and so for...). I will check if there is a GitHub offering a tutorial and we can ship that tutorial...
The problem is: doing ML without no idea whatsoever about stats is like offering a car with a motorbike engine...
My idea is to suggest few standard courses that could be doable by the average camper visiting and asking for help in this room, and ask them to follow those trainings: we could try to offer some assistant with exercises now and then, although it is expected to be self-pace / self-taught.
In principle, I am inclined towards the Google Series for the Machine Learning part. I will check the whole series though. I still need to find one for the stats and data analysis in general...
It should be basic.

@Rio99 hi, welcome to the room. What do you need?"

###In the WWW...:
I am sharing a link I found on Internet about a company that lives from helping governmental and NGO's in using **open data** for visualizations. Please check:

https://www.zimmermanzimmerman.nl/

The main data framework currently being used for those NGO's and GO's is the [**IATI standard**](http://www.aidtransparency.net/). I went to a meetup about the standard: the objective is encouraging all organisations to adopt the standard so every organisation could share information without much friction.

So for those who are interested in specialising on data, here just an opportunity you can investigate...

Happy Coding! Stay in Touch!"

Can we think in ways to automate the production of that information? I think this is why you are contacting @roelver... Are you planning to make an analysis or just to suggest who can pair with who? Or both? And are you planning to present that info to other campers? Anyway: you can come to ask for help anything, including testing or additional ideas... ;)
By the way, @george-stepanek : the API is finished but @roelver might not have the data yet. I think that FCC is still concern about what data to provide so their assumptions about camper's privacy are fulfilled.
@bitgrower now that Angular 1 is almost deprecrated they are just giving away all that material... I did wrong: I bought several books about MEAN just months before the announcement about Angular 2... it seems now as wasted money.... :)

###People
If you like, we can suggest a sort of official training for the FCC DSR, and we can suggest that everyone who is new should take a particular course. We can then help with those courses...
So we can have a **Data Science Room curriculum**?
A bit like FCC does with other material...

I was checking the link provided by @erictleung above and I can say **I haven't seen explanations so clear**. I haven't seen the full course but I am taking the risk to highly recommend it. You will be using Anaconda (which is a fully featured python framework).

@koustuvsinha @erictleung hmmmm... that one is something that I could have a look! @jameswinegar didn't recommend TensorFlow about 3 months ago, he found it a bit unstable, but I think Google will market it really strong, as well as the libraries that @kymanikd was referring the other day (she is more into advanced SEO)... I will check out...

Anyway, talking about TensorFlow... the idea of ""clinics"" is starting to round my head for a while... we can start selecting specific topics every month and if someone is under a particular topic, it would be nice to give a clinic of 5 minutes... Anyway, just an idea... sort of *meetups*"

Master data analysis with our newest course - SQL: Table Transformation!
What Will You Learn?

In SQL: Table Transformation, you'll use the power of SQL to transform data stored in relational databases.

Table transformation is the process of converting table data from one format to another. We’ll introduce new, intermediate techniques to transform data using SQL, including subqueries, set operations, conditional aggregates, and datetime and string functions.

I think I will contribute also. I don't know how I will make it like this, but I will try http://viewfromabove.emirates.com/3d. Note: it uses ordinary divs for circles and videos, not three.js so there is some math there

###The Week - what was going on?:
***MUSIC!!!!***
* presentation of a final draft of the **code comparison project**, now in [my repo](https://github.com/evaristoc/fccgitterDataScience/blob/master/Latent%20Semantic%20Analysis%20for%20%20Code%20Comparison.ipynb)
* presentation of a final draft of the **Network Graph project**, now in [my repo](https://github.com/evaristoc/gitterrooms_snaviz) and in [my C9](https://chatrooms-sna-example-ecccs.c9users.io/), with observations by @Lightwaves
* a post by me with personal views about **big data, data science, and predictive analytics in the private sector** as well as the possible **social impacts of AI**, with a short discussion
* a brief discussion about **Nature-Inspired Algorithms**, with links and books
* invitation to prepare a DSR project to build a **Report (Dashboard) of FCC's Services**; some people already showed interest in helping with this
* @Evaderei inviting to **prepare a compilation of DS links**, and discussion and experiences
* @Lightwaves and **The Panama Papers** as topic for DS
* Other:
 * posting begun by @koustuvsinha [here](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=570815308b17927458e2c0c1) about the recent landing success of the SpaceX's Dragon Rocket
 * links about **twitter libraries for python**; @theflametrooper's **FCC's Twitch.tv bot project**; **DS resources** (@Evaderei, @QuincyLarson); **CS50 course**; PROtips by @emilaasa; exploring other Gitter rooms; **guessthecorrelation** competition; 
 * @Lightwaves + @kymanikd about their experiences, music... and mood :)
 * @quatridunull about his return from a **covnet course**
 * brief discussion about the FCC survey status

###In the WWW...:
I think I would suggest to have a look to a online book about Nature-Inspired algorithms. My background is Life Sciences so you would understand why I felt very interested in this and similar books... The example codes of the selected book are on ruby, but you can go to the ruby room if you are lost :)

I'm a student at the University of Michigan (studying physics), and am taking computer vision this semester for fun. Here's the class page from last year, which is mostly the same as what I did this year: https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/eecs442-winter2015/schedule

I found the class to be extremely interesting, and learned a lot about how we can mathematically describe vision, and the amazingly interesting problems the field is trying to solve in order to get computers to have a human-like understanding of the world. Even though we can do amazing things like panorama stitching, object recognition, and even photo-realistic image generation from the computer's 'imagination', there are still so many things we haven't figured out yet. That's really exciting to me, and though I didn't previously think I would go to graduate school, this class is really making me reconsider that decision...

Anyway, what ended up being the problems with the hackathon idea? Did you guys shelve the idea, or is it just a definite no?"

Making a well deserved pause today and found your play list. I would say, add:
You should always (*always!*) start Faithless:
* Faithless - We Come 1

Then make a full stop, put reverse and turn LEFT, NO STOP!!!!! Turn it high and let that in...
* Paolo Nutini - Iron Sky [Abbey Road Live Session] (== yes, it will return to us! yes, we are not! yes, it is OURS!)

Stop by the gas station about 500km away...
* Låpsley - Falling Short

Watch out the small animals on the road, enjoy the scene...
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrpMncSZe-I

Drive then through the night into the city center...
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqWGbMUsLug
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAw1wxRYPDY
and very specially in this list...:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CkXhtw7UNk (turn it on!!!)

Park somewhere (no matter where)... get the underground and become a bit irreverent and neo-punk...
* King's Queer - Mon trou du cul est révolutionnaire 
> ""Nous ne sommes pas capitalisables,
nous sommes ingouvernables""
* Kings Queer - I'm Waiting For My Man 
(pair of lesbis or... well: I actually think they believe they are what they are, whatever it is what they think: they said to me they prefer no labels, please...)

... and go back home
* Michael Kiwanuka - Home Again

See all!!

I was also concentrated on other projects so I didn't put much effort on this...

However people in the Core Team appreciated the last report I made. That was a motivation to try to implement a programmable data collection and few viz's for all the resources. Also, I am getting better programmer now... :)

@koustuvsinha About the Gitter API: That was EXACTLY our first project for FCC about 6 months ago (@Lightwaves was there too, as well as Jideh)!!!! We can talk about it if you want: the Gitter Team changed the API so it has more limitations now... Gitter Team also suggested that they would offer some stats to account owners so it is a question to decide what a customised project could bring... I think there is something for sure! I will contact you later about that...

The project that I have in mind is monthly-based, so data collected for every month would be the target!!"

##For those interested in helping with a Full Report of Status of Services used by FCC:

The idea is to integrate data from all services and provide FCC with some few numbers in a CENTRALISED way. That would require to study and verify how we can integrate several API's for all those services.

 I have been checking already medium, twitch.tv, and currently checking twitter data. I am currently using python but I am planning to work that on node because HERE is EXACTLY where nodejs excels: we will require many different async calls. So the idea is to build a small express-based project.

This is also very much related to @samosale and eventually @alicejiang1 projects for Facebook (campsites).

Of course, Big Data has elements that definitively makes it different, particularly the fact that it is closer to AI, which is about giving machines the power to ""make decisions"". But for many other sectors, it could be just plain Predictive Analytics taken to a different level.

One very interesting point he made was that at the end *it is all about Small Data*: according to him, the *role of the new techniques was to reduce the noise existing in Big Data to a Small Data form* so you can do Predictive Analytics as usual. This was a very interesting idea, and in many situations he could be right. Remember my comments about what I found when going to a [Data Science Meetup a month ago](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56eb28db2316027b785e4e4c).

The point makes sense from a commercial of view, specially considering the needs of the private sector, which sometimes is not concerned about fine optimizations but rather *non-expensive solutions that **work for their purposes and goals** (ROI)*. I am still of [the opinion](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56e057ef383ddb914ef981b5) that companies for which a marginal gain could mean a bigger competitive advantage are some of those which will be innovating more and more in Data Science and Big Data. 

However I need to add also organisations who are after radical changes (I have mentioned possible new ways of Education, for example). Think the Apple mission of *changing the world*. The technology pushes to **automation**. In fact, a recent report by McKinsey suggests that many roles are prone to automation in the near future. Read the following articles:
http://www.networkworld.com/article/3004114/big-data-business-intelligence/even-the-ceos-job-is-susceptible-to-automation-mckinsey-report-says.html

http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/business-technology/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation

Those changes are here but they don't come without a price. They will face resistance and super barriers of entry do to its possible pervasive  impacts. Think about the social turmoil brought by closing coal mines during the 70's in UK after the oil became the main energy commodity.  "

###People:

##Those interested in Big Data and the Private Sector:

A recent report, more like an ad but still: somehow reveals some of the issues/limitations currently found with Big Data. As expected, there have been too many expectations on it: works, but not for everything... 

I make this conclusion based on some points mentioned in the report, although the article tries to make a totally different argument...
https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2W8YGB3&ct=160113&st=sg%3fls=Email&lsd=Internal&c=Email&cd=Internal

Not sure if you will have access... I needed to register in order to see the document...

 Still here the final sentence of the article:
> Consider alternative approaches and often multiple approaches because often it is not one single factor driving outcomes. Indeed, not all problems even require a fully engineered analytical solution. Investment may be better targeted on human factors, re-education or reframing the problem."

In this case though: the lower the value, the higher the similarity.

@SaintPeter the project is identifying 2 solutions that went extremely different to the other ones. I posted in the Core Team room last week that I found at least one hack while doing this project. I *suspect* those 2 solutions could be hacks. It is also possible that 2 people pairing used a similar hack, that is a good one.

Again, I have not checked: only commenting a potential (possibly overkill) use of this approach.

Udacity's Stats is good enough to start, yes... 
@Evaderei start with some elemental statistics, and if you are in computer since, SURELY Linear Algebra coupled with (ADVANCED) algorithms: many techniques involve the used of advanced heuristics and solutions used for NP-hard problems. It is possible that with the current tools you won't have to develop the code yourself, but you might need to understand the algorithms to understand what the technique is generally about.
@Evaderei are is veeeery statistical minded; start getting use to learn some statistics too...
python+SQL? probably... I would say python+Spark... I am going to try neo4j and redis in this room...
@Lightwaves :) :) :) From where are you taking such a nice material? Are you looking into my personal library? ""Elements of statistical learning or Baysian reasoning and machine learning"": VERY HARD to understand... you need MANY courses to get there... but keep going!!!
""Signal and the Noise""... I don't know that one...
@Lightwaves @Mius00: another thing... Did you see the ***red lines* in the chart I pasted yesterday?**. I suspect they are **CHEATERS**: we discovered there is a way to hack the solution for the algorithms (I found one by accident in my data). They could be also very outstanding solutions... Or an error in my project, of course... So let's see...

 Me, I wouldn't say I am data scientist myself, to be honest: I know something, probably more than many other people in the room, but there are people in FCC who might have more merits than me to be called Data Scientists...

Before continuing, I want to let you know for what I think we can use something like a **code comparison tool**:
A couple of days ago we in this room engaged in a discussion about the role of AI as a tool to improve learning (starting [here](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56fd9529e4a8384a1bbdc518)). I suggested the possible role of AI as a assisting the teachers and I am suggesting (futurism-me) that AI will take over some of the teaching roles specially in online training.

The project I have in mind is far from it (actually I don't know if I will succeed...). But my purpose is to formulate a demo that could recommend the student (in this case the campers) about ***how to improve the solution, assuming that we have ranked solutions, from best to worst***.

Suppose you already finished palindrome for the first time, but you don't know what else you could do to reach an *ideal* best ranked solution? You can consult a tool that will let you know **what things you *should* check, without giving you *the* solution, and guide you into correcting your work**. You may have an excess of variables, or an excess of comparisons, or needing a particular functionality...

A tool like this one can tell where you are know, and how much you may need to get to the ideal point...

This is in general the mental exercise of this project. I still need to see if I am doing the right things to get a acceptable demo...

You can see the errors in my parsing too... In fact, there are characters that should considered as 1 word, for example the `===` operator."

The list above is:
* a list including the parsed solution,
* a dict with counts of characters in the parsed solution, 
* the solution, 
* the time at which the solution was submitted, 
* an extraction of the used regex, and 
* a list of the original names of the variables

There is A LOT of (*wrong*) parsing because I am using python to ""uglify"" the codes. To improve the information from this project, I should select two possibilities IMO:
* using a python-js library and for every parsed code, save the data in IO and take the information that the js parser creates instead
* work the project in nodejs instead of python

I haven't still decided what to do... So far the result would have more errors that I would like because wrong parsing...

Anyway: *why parsing is sooo important for this project*? We need to reduce the noise that comes from *variables with different names but similar purpose*. Also we need to get rid of *non-valuable lines*, like console.logs or comments.

With the parsing, I got from 1000 different characters, to **less than 200**.   I am sure that with a more dedicated library I could reduce that to close to 100 or something, suggesting that we would require LESS than 100 different characters (including variable names) to make the solution for the palindrome algorithm. In the case above mentioned seems to be around 50 characters in total.

Anyway: for some specialised jobs I think that Data Scientist or someone with Data Science training would be currently earning more than many top ranked web developers, but it could be right saying that the number of offers for Data Science related jobs fall behind, particularly for freelance jobs. Furthermore I have the impression that the price competition for web developers is higher (many jobs but also many web developers), but I cannot support that claim

Last night @Mius00 and me were discussing how DataScience room could help with his final project for a Data Science course he is following at the University... We discussed a few options and I think there are nice possibilities for working together.

In the conversation, he also gave a couple of links that I want to share with you all:
* About his course, so you can have a first idea of the content of an introductory course in Data Science: http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/stjohn/teaching/data/. I think it is useful for those who are interested in the topic and want to start exploring some content. They are using Anaconda, so libraries are python-related.
* In particular for data visualization, python community is progressing in bringing a new interactive visualization library inspired by d3.js with a library called [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/). As it seems traditional with python projects, it ends sharing a lot of similarities with the d3.js. I haven't tried that before, but here you are.

--

Also an additional point:
I normally refer to this room as a place to work DS/Data Analysis topics with some use of JS for FCC, but given the new FCC proposal of including other languages, I will get rid of that constraint from now in the room presentation. So instead of:
> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

We will write:
> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects, with preference for using FCC data.

Be aware though that **JS is still preferred when working on projects for FCC, because it is the language FCC uses**.

##For those interested in practising Statistics as well as Viz using the Survey Data:

If anyone is interested in working on the survey results, my idea is to make  few SIMPLE statistical analyses on the survey and present the data to other campers using online technologies.

**To analyse the data**, I think we should keep it REALLY simple so I believe that JS would be enough. Those who want to get fancy, just make proposals.

**For the Viz** I am thinking that an appropriate tool could be dc.js or any similar library *easier* than d3.js (NOT d3js) that allows cross-references between charts.

Let me know who is interested? Better if we make a small team..."

Typeform does not allow you to have a select box and also accept ""other"" for some reason. It's an annoying limitation. I've added industrial engineering to the list, though."

`Do you want to...` 
I think something among the lines ""which would you prefer"" would be a bit  clearer that it's a ""choose the one you want most"" instead of a multiple choice (sort of like `Which of these jobs are you most interested in?`)

`Would you prefer to work...`
Currently it asks either from home or in an office,  I think it might help to have a ""no preference"" option, as someone might skip answering this question because they don't have a preference for working either from home/office.

`Which types of in-person coding events have you attended?`
I suggest adding an option for `none`, currently a respondent might ""other"" for ""none"" and you'll have more data to manually comb. If they don't select any options, it'll be unclear if they are responding that they haven't been to events, or if they decided to decline answering the question.
`What was the main subject you studied in university?`
Majors not in the list aren't being accepted as inputs, (Industrial Engineering was not in the list, though I was able to continue by setting it as ""Engineering"")

* me working on a real time data collection app for Network Graphing
* me working on code comparison tool
* FCC API (*relevant project to be ready soon*): @roelver's project
* @QuincyLarson about list of possible questions for a future survey
* @abhisekp's questions about GA
* Other: 
 * links in: **Social Media Analysis**, including theory and practice; **specialization** as strategy; **problems and solutions for NP-hard problems** in python; also **@demipixel's article**; comment about **sparce matrices**; @Lightwaves **about reaching DataScience nirvana infographics**; AI **chatbots going wrong**

###In the WWW...:

For those who have a certain feeling about maths, I think I would recommend to watch the **Erdös documentary** using the [link provided by @samosale](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56f45a8ad9b73e635f663eb1). I liked it...

That... and **Deadpool**: sort of Blockbuster *a la* Tarantino. Not fan of blockbusters myself but the direction of the film and the dialogs are  outstanding. For this one better to go to the cinema!!

To store into GA better to use the GA tag. You can load files but that could be painstaking and not what you want. You will have to create a programmable logic to set the GA tag **event tracker** to capture information about function names and counting values. You can use FCC implementation as an example. However, the event tracker imposes several limits, like for example the number of events that can be collected per session during certain period of time, implying you will need to set your tool in terms of GA capabilities and make conclusions based on those limits. GA reports may disagree with your totals, only because the goals of the tools are not the same and therefore the reported values are based on different assumptions and areas of interest.

I suggest to read GA online documentation.

There are things about your project that make me feel GA is not what you are looking for... It seems to me that your project is more about better debugging, efficiency and code optimisation, not just focused on front-end optimisation and conversion analysis which is where GA is used most of the time. IMO log files, or even better a DB, could be more suitable, but you will have to face the issues of handling sessions and IPs (not recommended!!!!) if you want to make valuable aggregate stats per different types of users.

IN CASE you don't find a better option I would suggest you to understand the differences between both tools and make conclusions based on their capabilities."
55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2016-03-27T11:17:11.011Z	540a150e163965c9bc202eaf	abhisekp	56f7c137aaf8f1a914e66a71	@evaristoc there is a [**`counting`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/counting) module but it passes a count as 1st param. Btw, This is for a CLI project. So e.g. when someone tries to do something using the executable, internally, various functions are executed. So a module similar to [**`measured`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/measured) which would track various aspects of the app (my primary target is just function calls and functionality usuage frequency like WebStorm or any of the Jetbrains IDEs does). Then upload the usage stats to GA or any other meters/measuring free services. 
55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2016-03-27T11:07:32.355Z	5586719a15522ed4b3e23add	evaristoc	56f7bef48d2a72471b7a8a72	"@abhisekp interesting question... 

If the function is called after user interaction with a front-end resource, I think GA can help as it has event-driven capabilities. Eg. we have a counter implemented in FCC implemented with GA to capture the number of times someone tries to finish a challenge. Google people are making GA available at client as well as at server but for them client interaction is the most important aspect. If your counting is related to user interfaces, GA could be an option. Let me know if you need help with this.

If the evaluation of the function call is not directly related to an event or user interaction, I suspect you may need another type of library. I don't know any as I haven't tried this before. I suspect making a customised implementation could be the way to go: what about implementing a class, eg. a decorator, to count when functions are called?

Anyway: if you find a solution, can you please let us know here?"

* the field (eg. programming? life change? business administration? k-12 education level?...)
* the target user  and demographics
* the market (eg. mentoring people in Africa or other less developed countries?)
* the time you think the mentoring is required for completing the task (eg. a short conversation? a long term relation that require follow up?)

Try to create *personas* and then define your user stories based on that.

IMO: Making the basic implementation will be some kind of standard: the app will succeed because of the details, utility, and its capacity to gain target users..."

There is a [milestone on Github](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/milestones) for the API. The first version will be hosted on Heroku with FCC data coming in by manual file synchronization. So it will not be realtime in the first release. The database for the API is an export of the FCC users collection, enriched with summary counts over the completed challenges. 
The REST API will have 2 endpoints. One is returning an array of users (max 100 per request), extended with the challenge counts (alltime/past 30 days). The other endpoint will return all available data for a single user (by username), with the solution code for completed challenges and the URLs for completed projects.

I looked for some API frameworks to use: Loopback and FeathersJS. But the required API is very simple, and will probably stay that way for some time, since there's only user data to expose. Any other CRUD operations are not allowed via the API. That's why I will just build it with Express routes and controllers. See a more [detailed design](https://www.dropbox.com/s/96x7fp74ui05gin/FCC-API%20design.pdf?dl=0).

**Hi People**:
FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN THE SOCIAL NETWORK CHAPTER:
Getting enthusiastic about the possibilities we will be have working with social-related data, definitively. I am just calling this Chapter of the DataScience room after [Erdös](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s), an interesting, turned-drug-adict contemporary mathematician NOT known for his contributions to SNA and still been a reference for numerous SNA projects (look for the Erdös Number).

I think this project is interesting, have impact, it is challenging, it's fashion, and more importantly: it's *cooooool!*

So, a pair of useful material:
http://dmml.asu.edu/smm/book/ (the theory...)
http://miningthesocialweb.com/ (... and the practice)

---

@alicejiang1 contact you later today, to see if we can do something... enjoy!

While applying an SVD method to solve for code comparison I confronted a [*sparse matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) (more zero's than non-zero values). My matrix is extremely small so I am not facing visible performance issues. But what happen when you have to deal with extremely large matrix structure with just 0.1% of non-zero values? One of the common problems is memory. Finding an optimum in those situations is more demanding.
Just to give you an idea, I am attaching a link of someone asking for help in stackexchange:
http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/41259/how-to-compute-svd-of-a-huge-sparse-matrix

This is a common problem, so be aware of it!!!!"

If that is all what we need to run your code, great! But then I was to suggest to take those numbers to make some additional crunching stats. For example, by (sub-)continent, main countries, growth estimates, etc... This is what will take your viz a bit further...

That was my idea... what do you think?"

Another link about Social Media, more general and with a marketing focus. 
http://www.deloittedigital.com/us/blog/social-media-analytics-what-its-good-for-and-what-its-not

----

**OBS**: 

Although the use of Social Media for marketing is commonly stressed, be aware that these types of analyses have a broad application. You may already know about the use of Social Media Analytics Apps for catastrophe management, for example. 

You might think that given the numerous applications you as developer will be already successful by trying a general utility. Unfortunately that is difficult to achieve. Sometimes the specialisation is the key.

For example, I was just listening to the radio where someone was speaking about its use in Security and the person said something that we should take in consideration. Simply put, the person said:
> The existing information is so vast that nowadays you have to specialise.

This is an interesting observation that I already mentioned to @darwinrc in a [previous post](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56e072b7383ddb914ef98b3b). 

**However** there are many common places that would allow different specialised implementations to share the same room (the DataScience Room?).

So post about your interests!"

##THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:

>DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

[Previous Digest](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56e69e6d6fde057c268684db)

*Tentative DSR site*: http://evaristoc.github.io/FreeCodeCamp_DSR/

*Everyone recommended...*: ""Data Science from Scratch"" book by Grus


---

###Last Week:

* @ChristianBertram's **Danish programming competition**, http://www.datalogi-ol.dk/User/Login
* me working on a **real time viz for a network graph of interactions in the FCC gitter main room**
* @Mius00 presenting nice **links about students' Data Mining projects**
*  me about a recent visit to a **meetup about Data Science, Digital Analytics**
* @koustuvsinha's suggestion about **A. Karpathy course in neural networks**
* @Lightwaves about **costs of GPU in AWS**
* @QuincyLarson about **Stack Overflow and Open Data plans**
* me about a **Big Research Question for the DSR**
* Other:
 * trends: link about the impact of NLP in future web design

---

###In the WWW...:

First:
###I am exploring the making of a DSR webpage: http://evaristoc.github.io/FreeCodeCamp_DSR/

If proves successful and not too cumbersome, we could include  special sections, a database and search engines, etc... perhaps moving into a CMS... Not because we are a big group at the moment, but it just make everything tidier... The page will be updated when required and available at every Digest.

Additionally,  a couple of medium articles that I found interesting readings. One by a FCC camper and [coding from meteorologist perspective](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/coding-from-a-meteorologist-s-perspective-3c81aa9c1160#.iuzua83ha). The other one, about a [not-that-futurist perspective of the impact of AI](https://medium.com/basic-income/deep-learning-is-going-to-teach-us-all-the-lesson-of-our-lives-jobs-are-for-machines-7c6442e37a49#.d5p6zdgbi) after the Go game Challenge.

The objective of this room is exploring topics in DataScience/DataAnalytics by including and learning some JS tools. To have a excuse we are focusing on FCC data but is not exclusive: we can use whatever data we want to show here. Quincy just suggested that stackoverflow is making its data open this year, for example. All data you want, as long as we contribute a bit with experiencing some work in JS stack, alone or combined with other tools."

I am going to quickly disclose the idea that I will propose to @Mius00 to work. It is based on research question that just occurred to me yesterday while studying networks. It goes as follows:

As you have maybe realised, FreeCodeCamp doesn't have mentors. Most of the ""mentoring"" is the knowledge transfer through campers with different level of expertise that participate in the different meeting resources. For what I have seen, chatrooms are the first point of knowledge transfer, then other channels (FCC encourages the use of pairing, and currently streams).

The general research question is:
> how influencial those channels are on the final solutions given by campers?

More specifically:
> how influential *the people central at those channels* are on the work of other campers?

I tried different things but I couldn't solve the issues I wanted to solve. However my last solution is still worth sharing, as it is partially responding to some features that I wanted to introduce, like **highlighting nodes**.

Started working on the code comparison project.
First preparing the data with python. Just one record (word counting):
```
['function palindrome  (  str  )  { str = str  .  replace  ( /[^\\ w ]|/ g  ,  """" )  str = str  . toLowerCase (  )  compare = str . split ( \'\' )  . reverse (  )  . join ( \'\' )  if  (  str == compare  )  { return true } else { return false } } palindrome ( ""eye"" ) ',
 defaultdict(<class 'int'>, {'': 22, 'replace': 1, 'w': 1, 'g': 1, '/[^\\': 1, 'palindrome': 2, '{': 3, 'if': 1, 'function': 1, 'reverse': 1, 'compare': 2, '}': 3, '==': 1, ""''"": 2, ']|/': 1, ')': 8, 'str': 7, '(': 8, 'false': 1, '.': 5, 'toLowerCase': 1, '""""': 1, '=': 3, 'else': 1, '""eye""': 1, 'split': 1, ',': 1, 'return': 2, 'join': 1, 'true': 1})]
```

There are 328 records about palindromes captured from the Torrent Dataset. Not many. There are some reasons why that could be but I still think that my code is not capturing all...

I will be converting data into json... the method, as mentioned before, will be SVD. Still thinking what part of the calculation should be made by nodejs but it should be some. I will be using the sylvester library mentioned last week.

 It should be online. I might need something like a markdown previewer to introduce new code. Any help?"

Just coming from a **meetup about Data Science**. Encountering old friends...
http://www.meetup.com/Digital-Analytics/events/229406157/

Representatives of important companies like **booking.com** (online hotel bookings, probably the biggest nowadays) or **Transavia** (airline, Europe) were giving talks. Also a CQM data scientist. The host company was **Travix** (an European sister company of **Travelocity**, from **Expedia**).

I summarise:
* Corporative, as it should be in these cases: no much information for disclosure
* Only by watching the presentations, you could claim that the coursera course would be enough for getting into the business... It looked like there is some standardisation and model simplicity (= cost reduction)
* Guess what? *Natural Language Processing is gaining momentum again*. The existing available tools are also more advanced and mature than before. Anyway: **we ** (actually *I*) **have been doing some NLP here** (yea!!!...?). In particular, user reviews (=user experience) and ratings were very important for them.
* Those who are expecting to see a lot of **supervised machine learning?** you would be surprised how much a simple k-mean clustering is preferred...
* For those who have worked on **recommender systems**... you would be surprised how useful a non-personalised recommender is hard to beat...
* The difference to what we have? The amount of data they use (Hugeeee!) AND the need of having a project in batch mode => non-stop. Our projects are occasional demos with no much data.
 * There is a myth-bluster: they don't get every detail about users (user privacy policy; scope of online data; etc) and have hugeeee sparse matrices (a lot of cells with no data to fill in).

---

*About standardisation and model simplicity in the use of models*:

I must admit that I was surprised for the common use k-mean clusters or classification trees though. I guess either there should be some differences in some details that were not mentioned or simply put: the simple models were much better than their more expensive counterparts...

Other driver to prefer the simplest model possible could have been *cost*. When I was practising in kaggle I was actually discussing one project based on that premise: more precise algorithms require A LOT more hardware (remember: I said before that solving for Data Mining shares analogies with solving an NP-hard problem using approximation algorithms!!!). So a company who has to use the results of any Data Mining / Machine Learning implementation should invest a lot more in hardware to effectively go for precision. That precision comes with a cost that MUST be justified, not only in money, but culturally (for those who don't still know: organisations have CULTURES)."

###People interested in algos: check the Danish competition (ask @ChristianBertram)!
If they say it can be solved in 1sec it is because no brute force solution is allowed and they are exact solutions. A good knowledge of maths (like linear algebra) will help a lot...

@jbmartinez @jameswinegar : did you remember my idea about the hackaton-ish project? Check the site of the Danish competition suggested by @ChristianBertram, ddd.codejudge.net/2016/  : exactly in that direction, so someone already took the lead :)

@Mius00 I would like to advise you but how good are you in python? numpy / matplotlib are like learning a dialect of a language. regex is another thing: you really need to study it apart.

@Mius00 the final project: what is the idea? Data Analysis?

I am participating in  a programming (informatics) competetion, for gymnasium students, which is really fun. Round 2 is over now, and I got the permision to share the challenges and maybe more importantly the test cases with you. 
It's just 3 challenges, the first of which is almost trivial. I have no idea how hard you will think they are, but they are probably going to be really easy for some, while others might find them more interesting :)
They have been friendly enough to keep up a testserver for everyone (source code has to be in Java, C, C++ or some other old language though - no javascript). On the server your program will be tested against around 10 test cases, but the most interesting thing, is the timelimit of 1 sec :) You just need to create a user to get going.
You can see the challenges and submit answers (as many times as you want) at ddd.codejudge.net/2016/ .  This is in danish, but I think you'll be able to navigate the page (When in doubt you are welcome to ask me). The only challenge written in english is the one named ""Clocks"" if you want the one named ""Supermarked"" I can translate it (just ask me).
Have fun!"

#THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:

> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

[Previous Digest](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56dc4f6612636738357156dd)

---

###Last Week:

* posting about how to become a Data Science and some perceptions about the role (@Lightwaves , @darwinrc, me); excellent links and posts about trends in the sector including:
 * Data Science opportunities, 
 * the role of semantic search, 
 * deep learning
 * trainings
 * IoT
* link about **JS tools and nodejs** for data scientists; another about **the Linear Algebra's sylvester project** for JS 
* a good youtube video link about a presentation of **barracuda app** 
* links about **flask**, **socket.io**, **node.js clustering**, a some more...
* @Mius00 proposed using camperbot to drop datascience links, and also mentioned [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
* links about **combining nodejs and python**
* one link about ***chatroom analysis***

---

###In the WWW...:
I have already posted *a lot* of links! And there will be more for sure. However, I would like to make a special case for one about a [demo](http://spintag.de/) (2013) made by Mario Klaue for several reasons:
* the demo is about combining nodejs, jQuery tools, socket.io and d3js
* a very clean, just-to-the-point code; those sort of codes that make difficult seems to look easy; inspiring...
* the mentioning and use of a jQuery-based library with an object oriented + event-driven approach to create front-end controllers, **can.js**

Have a look! You will learn not just one but many things by studying the Klaue's demo!

It is a pity this is the *only* demo that Klaue made in his blog  of just two posts. The demo is written in English of a mainly German-written blog. 

---

###Next Week:
* I will shortly deliver a *very simple* demo using socket.io and d3.js with express to get data from Gitter chatrooms.

The edX, as you say is more informative and kind of low quality, in fact, I had paid for the certificate but given the low quality of the former ones I asked for a refund. I recommend to take a look at it but not to pay for the certificate (even if you won't get the xseries, which I was aiming to).  Regarding your question about Colombia, this year, the first university will offer a MsC program in information engineering (aka data science) and there is an open data government initiative in course. However, the field is still in its inception stage.

I am really curious about the edX course too... It seems more like a general information course but still sounds good...

Regarding IoT: Here in Europe is gaining momentum and there are several start-ups as well as root movements with a focus on applications to solve social issues. What about Colombia? Projects that you know? A quick view suggests that in Colombia it is still just an academic topic. Am I wrong?

@Lightwaves : it sounds discouraging, yes. And I partially agree with author. My opinion is that some positions will come up where knowing just a fraction will be enough to give you a chance, specially if combined with other skills and knowledge.

And yes: specially Scala is becoming really popular. Java is already popular: all Hadoop and family is build on Java.

The point he is trying to make is knowing Matlab/Mathmatica/R isn't enough, it's harder to integrate with already built applications. Say you develop an algorithm that translates words, you'd have trouble building an application or service that takes advantage of that. If it was built in on one of the three above. If you knew something like c++ you could write a plugin for node or build a restful api in another language which node could talk to.

The other point is one of models tend to break down, if you don't know the math you can't fix, modify or create a new model that can better describe the problem you are trying to solve.

In my opinion, keep 3 things in mind when working with ML and DM:
* the artistic part of this is Feature Engineering; not easy
* Usually, the form of your solution should be usually constrained within at least two statistical paradigms: Bayesian (NICE!) or Frequentist - the last one I would called Gaussian. Why statistics? You need an optimisation goal as well as to defend your results.
* I would say that in practice DM techniques would be similar to solutions for  NP-hard optimisation problems. If you understand the problem you are facing, you might offer a good computational solution if you are good in algos. If you haven't take any training in Discrete Optimisation yet, do it now.

I would suggest also to specialise: finance? marketing? healthcare?

Thanks, @darwinrc for considering my advice... Be aware that there are people here in this room that can have a different opinion and even giving you a better advice than me. Anyway: hope this helps. If you have other questions just DM (también soy de LA)."

The following is all my opinion:

For what I have seen currently is becoming more important, yes. This is because many companies are more and more aware of needing professionals that guarantee Return On Investment. Not all sectors requiring DS have similar requirements for the role, but it will be if a small improvement in a given solution means a marginal increase in return. In some very competitive sectors that small difference could be decisive of being on top or out of business. Example of a sector? Stock Market service providers.

Although the DS job market seems to offer a lot of potential it seems to be maturing in many aspects, like for example the preferred technologies and architectures. On the other hand, many sectors have delayed DS adoption until the offer gets more mature to guarantee their requirements (banking, for example).

Unfortunately I can't give you other advice than taking a uni training in related areas if your interest is DS (as I have mentioned before, I didn't take one).

I would say: it is *possible* that the job market will become *more specialised* in the future, for example a web developer with demostrable interest and or experience in DS, and for that DS online trainings could be an excellent option. Similarly, roles like Data Analyst could be reshaped and  demanding more DS-like skills in the future (I have seen that...).

Hope this helps..."

I need to understand some technical issues though: my plan is to collect data from several rooms simultanously, so I don't know if I will need workers for that (a worker per each FCC chat room...)"

The author suggests that the  is not the best way to learn ML because:
 * the use of Octave/Matlab, 
 * no indication of how to make feature selection, 
 * use of small datasets,
 * many other techniques are ignored

In the first place, the course is about an introduction to ML techniques, not DS. However it is true that it is just an introduction. Take the training to focus on the 101 theory and exercises about the techniques: they are very well explained!

Then, when talking about Matlab (which is a very powerful language too...), I would say: if learning Matlab/Octave you could have a first introduction to python's scipy-numpy, which are commonly used for ML with python and are syntactically based on Matlab (actually: python scipy-numpy fall behind Matlab in some aspects).

It is true that I don't hear many DS positions using Matlab, but [here it is an example that happens](https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs/2002-remote-data-scientist-cortex). There are niche sectors were you *must* know Matlab.
 
Additionally: Matlab/Octave forces to think in terms of matrices, which is core to data analysis anyway.

I have to be totally agree with feature engineering: there is nothing about in the course and it is VERY important.

Finally he suggests that you should know about all. In my opinion, think that it is possible that some organisations might be looking for someone who covers just one aspect of the whole thing. For example: the author suggests that *a DS should know about JS, and particularly D3.js*. Other thing to understand is back-end (the main focus of the author is *Django*). Well: guess what: **we are having sections on those technologies here!** So don't feel discouraged. But you have to work though...

Yes: apart of simple parsing, the uglifier tries to build more info around the code. Thanks for the links! 

For the approach I am thinking (comparing only exercises of same algorithm), an uglifier seems to be an overkill, I reached the same conclusion as you already mentioned. I am not sure about minmifier.

It is possible that the effectiveness of this approach wouldn't be enough if the project is to compare solutions for DIFFERENT algorithms, or, as I proposed to someone in this room few days ago, to compare more complex projects like codepens.

Anyway: I haven't done any comparison yet (only preparing data and the couple of parsing regex I mentioned...)."

I might search for `/\bkeyword\b/` to ensure we're getting a whole keyword and not a partial (IE: `for` in `format`.  I could also see slightly more complex regexes for things like `/for\s*\(` or `/if\s*\(/`.   I think even a naive analysis can give us important information.  Manual review of outliers will enable us to see if our assumptions are bad.
I like uglifier, though, because it eliminates the possibility of prople using `var string = some value` or `var array = [1,2,3]` being false hits.  
It also is something to be said for a tried and true uglifier used in production to remove comments and do other translation for us - it means we don't have to ""reinvent the wheel""."

@bitgrower keep in touch

@SaintPeter : I made some preliminary cleaning of the text and I found that for this exercise uglifying might not be necessary; a simple parser based on a couple of regex commands to ""normalise"" the text and eliminating things like comments can be easily implemented; also the data would require to consider *all* words and even characters but semi-colons, as they are meaningful for a working code in JavaScript.
My idea is to attack this problem using what it is called [*latent semantic indexing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing). This is probably one of the simplest solutions for this exercise. For the use of SVD for text mining you can simply read [this page](http://econometricsense.blogspot.nl/2011/11/singular-value-decomposition-and-text.html).
For more advanced solutions, a JS parser could be needed."

""Algorithm Solution Similarity""
### Goal
Determine how common various types of solutions to the Algorithm Challenges are.  
### Process
* Create a list of Javascript Keywords (IE:  `for`, `if`, `while`, etc) 
* Run each solution through an ""uglifier/minmifier"" which will change all variable names to generic names and remove comments.
* Scan each solution for the js keywords.  Keep a count of each keyword, creating a ""signature"" for that solution.  IE:
```js
function palindrome(str) {
    str = str.replace(/\W|_/g, '').toLowerCase();
    var revStr = str.split('').reverse().join('');
    return revStr === str;
}
```
translates to:
```js
{
  ""replace"": 1,
  ""var"": 1,
  ""split"": 1,
  ""reverse"": 1,
  ""join"": 1
}
```
* Output these signatures in a standard fashion so they can be easily/quickly compared
* Create histogram of signatures

## Future
 Break out functions/keywords by high level type (IE: `keyword`, `string function`, `array function`, `functional programming`)"

##THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:

> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

[Previous Digest](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56cb73a9631af87d5c4508fc)

----

###Last Week...:

* campersites visualization in 3D (@samosale's project's saga)
* few links about topics in Open Source, as well as the dark side of some online education platforms
* I have been working in an article for medium

---

###Who is in? (collaborations?)

???

###In the WWW...:

Feeling more confident with basic D3js, it is time for me to get into the last ""A"" of [my ""DABDA"" emotional pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model), shake off all the hangover left after hours trying to understand **angular 1.3**, and get into a new world: I will be trying to introduce **reactjs** in my code in the next months.

It is why I am sharing the following with you:
* A particularly interesting introduction of working with D3 and react
  http://nicolashery.com/integrating-d3js-visualizations-in-a-react-app/
 One interesting remark by the author:
 > I think that using React and D3.js together makes sense because they share a common philosophy of ""give me a set of data, tell me how it should be rendered, and I'll figure out which parts of the DOM to update for you"". Indeed, React has its virtual DOM diffs, and D3.js has its update selections, making both quite efficient in the business of keeping the UI in sync with data changes.

* However, other professionals question the ways react and d3 should be coupled, and are more about suggesting the *Right Way*.
 http://oli.me.uk/2015/09/09/d3-within-react-the-right-way/
 An interesting remark by the author:
 > If you give an element React created to D3 and say “hey, D3, set the width to 100, thanks” it’ll happily oblige. Then React will notice and get pretty upset that you went behind its back and messed with its perfectly reconciled DOM. This isn’t great, as you can imagine.
 > 

* I am personally letting Threejs for later but it will come... Meanwhile, check @samosale's first effort if you haven't done it

---

###Next Week...:

* I will see if I find time to work on one project I like: a code comparison; I decided to test Singular Value Decomposition for this problem - I think it will be ok...
* studying the implementation of affinity/association mining, sequential path mining or similar for analysing student paths?

---

###Wish List:

> creating small teams to analyse different aspects of the data and come every end of the month, for example, in order to put all our findings together for FCC to check"

One of the most influencing projects that started as a external project but ended up to be part of FreeCodeCamp is the camperbot, by @dcsan, who has been working on bots for years.

There are several works in FCC that are forked projects from camperbot, but a recent initiative by @bugron (who is currenly a FCC Moderator) consists in a bot that will supervise the Push Request for changing FCC main code, mostly for changes in the curriculum content. The code will identify who is the Moderator that are those moderators that are more likely to take ownership for any change made by any other camper. Moderators have specific privileges and responsibilities related to Quality Assurance of any proposed change.

Keep an eye of this new feature if you are interested in contributing with FCC code base! Who knows: you may ""steal"" some ideas later for your own projects!! ;)"

Hi @/everyone
##THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:

> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

[Previous Digest](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56c087ea37437b67560930b2)

>---

Hi EVERYONE!

>---

### Last Week...:

* more about big data in education and Learning Analytics
* campersites visualization 2 (@samosale's project)
* working on the Torrent Dataset in python and d3: experimenting with Sankey diagrams to analyse camper's paths
* working on chatroom analysis: bar charts for help requests about bonfires

>---

### Who is in? (collaborations?)

* ???

  >--- 

###In the FCC News...:

* ???

>---

### Next Week...:

* I will see if I find time to work on one project I like: a **code comparison**; I decided to test  [*Singular Value Decomposition*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) for this problem - I think it will be ok...
* studying the implementation of market basket analysis, sequential path mining or similar for analysing student paths
* preparing a short article for medium about bonfires/algorithms

>---

### Wish List:

> creating small teams to analyse different aspects of the data and come every end of the month, for example, in order to put all our findings together for FCC to check"

1) The Sankey diagram, is a test and shows the steps through the curriculum as indicated in the first page of my bl.ocks:
> Nodes are named as **step + _ + challenge-code**.

Nodes
> ... represent a step where they solved a challenge of the curriculum.

Steps are the order of the solved challenges. Some people might solve a challenge A at step x while other would solve the same challenge at step y.
Challenge-codes are given in the same bl.ocks page (but unfortunately wrongly formatted in the bl.ocks page).

2) The chart above is an analysis of the **Help chatroom** and I am making an approximation to requests for help. Those are counts of the name of the function of each challenge. The project assumes that if someone makes a copy of the code of the challenge in the chat it is because the person is looking for help for that challenge most of the time. It also assumes that the name of the function that solves each challenge won't be changed.

* Sankey diagrams were offering interesting hints when the number of nodes was relatively small. For example, during the period of Feb to Apr 2015 before change of curricula, most of the campers sampled during that time (about 1000) followed similar paths, with few exceptions. That helped to make a visualisation.
* However, since the April 2015 change in the curriculum, the number of campers grew reaching 30 times the Feb-Apr amount by Sep-Nov same year, and with that the number of starting points and possible paths. Additionally, the number of challenges like waypoints grew, implying more starting points and different paths. A simple Sankey diagram became insufficient and non-effective visualization on those conditions.
* For a more effective analysis after that period it would be possible that we should apply tools more in the area of [*sequential pattern mining*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_pattern_mining) and visualizations more used in that area.
* Sankey diagrams could still be a useful technique if we can fragment the data, for example analysing each starting point separately. But the identification of bottlenecks (places where the abandon rate is higher) or aggregations points (nodes that are very common along all paths) might not be easily identified."

People:
I have been working on **tracking the paths of campers through the curriculum from beginning to end/drop-out**. The data I am using is from the Torrent Dataset.

To visualise the paths I am using [*Sankey diagrams*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram). This is more an exercise: the common paths are trivially revealed by simple statistics. What the Sankey diagram could be useful for in cases like this one is to actually put in evidence those ***small steps along the flow that could bring a large difference in the final outcome***. You still miss relevant info using that technique for this problem. For example in its simple form the diagram may not be taking in account the time-to-completion at each step of the curriculum.

I am not showing the results right now because they are still too raw. But if you are interested in building Sankey diagrams with pure D3, I would suggest to start with [this link](http://www.d3noob.org/2013/02/formatting-data-for-sankey-diagrams-in.html). As the author of the blog/book suggests the hardest part is to format the data that goes into the D3 plug-in for Sankey diagrams."

Although it may add additional burden to your code it has two advantages that you can use in your favour for those lines:
1) You have the transition method already there
2) Remember that D3 is excellent handling arrays: if you generate an array with random connections between cities that you can delete/add at any transition event then D3 will be more convenient library
Otherwise you will have to create the transition function and the random array functionality from scratch. If you can do it so, fine!"

As the times passes it adds blinking dots to the map, but with increasing number of dots so does animated flying dot decrease in performance and becomes slower. It  gets to only 7fps if you look too long, and may even affect the performance of your system if you have lot of apps running. But when I remove blinking animation all is fine- i get 60fps.

Problem is d3.timer- it updates two paths - the first is all circles and the second continents in the third example and FCC cities in the second example. That is too much for the dom to handle in 16ms.
Did  you see web-gl globe link I sent you? 
I am planing to make it with that library. But for now, I will first make flat earth map with FCC cities.
 I will try to fetch all groups on Faceboook using phantom.js and cheerio/jquery, in order to extract size of each group. Then I will use that data to compare ratio between city population and group size. That would be very interesting to see.Hint: I think that San Francisco will have bigest ratio...


Yes you can link in Reddit. I don't know where to link my example. Don' t use twitter.

1) yeah, I tried cheerio. But have some problem with website because he was giving me even the names of restourants that have same name as the city i am looking for. Also had issues with async nature of my scrapping. Basically I have a list of 197 cities without coordinates, and foreach of them i scrap website. But i think I will solve async nature of iteration. 

2) I have a list of 753 cities with geocord. Compare that to 4000 cities from spining example. Obviously the shape of the chart won't be the same and wont look like earth. So, i decided to append shapes of continent, but animation just becames too laggy because of too much dom elements. That is the problem with D3- it is not capable to do serious animation because he uses dom ,and dom is slow. I will try to merge that list of 4000 cities with list of FCC cities and I will give another color to FCC cities. 
3) i will try to build two more charts. One will be just like this but  with TREE.js, which will give chart the smoothness of animation. The second will be flat earth chart with some css animations.

I imagine that there exist publically available datasources of many types, but without specifics you're not going to find one.  I imagine that most publically available data would not have signficant market value.  I'm a little suprised that ebay has something like that, but I guess it makes sense since they're in the business of being a middle man.

It's very helpful so someone who wants to sell that item has a better guess of the success

Are you asking if there exist websites that allow for data collection?  Or if there exists a website which has market research about the types of apps that people would like to have created?
55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2016-02-15T18:00:14.931Z	55d2c4f40fc9f982beadb9c1	Mashadim	56c2122e0295dc53403e6a57	I know there are websites that allow people to write what kind of app they are interested for people to create but I was wondering if there was a more data driven place that visually showed this...My question is general because I dont know if this even exists or what to name it.
55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2016-02-15T17:57:24.953Z	54ee77ff15522ed4b3dc7cbb	SaintPeter	56c2118418ec94cf47676967	@Mashadim Your question is a bit general.  There is no one way or tool to do what you desrcribe.  It's going to vary significantly with many different things - data source, is the data availialbe publically via an API or other formatted source.  Other data that you describe may be privately held and not directly available.  Yet other types you may need to collect yourself via a tool like Google  Analytics.

I am really curious about this for a long time and i don't know where to start.

For that, cheerio package is the best known. For scraping the most important is to understand the DOM, although some Regex skills may be also useful now and then. Scraping is not a sustainable solution: pages usually change. But for one-time solution could be ok.

If you need some examples you could go and have a look at @luishendrix92's ""Solution Getter"" (check his GitHub repo). There are also other scrapers developed here but the solution getter is a simple and effective one.

Then you will find a lot of material on Internet.

Success!"

##THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:

> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

[Previous Digest](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56b8b5d98e641d833058f8b9)

**Hi EVERYONE!**
*Torrent Dataset*:
I made a simple comparison between how new registered campers dealt with different part of 2 different FreeCodeCamp curricula found at different periods. Periods were Feb-Apr 2015 (period 1) and Sep-Nov 2015 (period 2). Those two periods represent 2 different curriculum formats. The second one is more complete with waypoints, JS training and jQuery training. Additionally in the first curriculum all basejumps were presented together and then the ziplines, while in the second one bonfires are inserted between additional activities and separated in basic, intermediate and advanced.
I counted how many new registers came at each period and how many of them finished bonfires, ziplines or basejumps before the period closed.
Sample sizes were very different (period 1: 991; period 2: 34061).
For this quick analysis I found that:
* New registers in period 1 tended to finish **2 times** more bonfires than those in period 2
* New registers in period 2 tended to finish **6 times** more ziplines than those in period 1
* Not enough data was collected for basejumps

It could be that the changes made in the curriculum after Apr 2015 induced students to put bonfires aside and go for ziplines instead. The curriculum in the second period was (is) more zipline-focused. It could be also possible that the generation of new registers in period 2 included a larger number of campers with already good skills for web dev who might be less interested in bonfires and more in ziplines.

*Bonfires in the Help Channel*:
I found a nice and relatively easy way to capture some help requests in the gitter chatrooms: just trying to get the function name of the bonfire. In that way I counted how many times the code was presented in the chat, assuming that if someone presents a code is because he/she is generally looking for help. A first graph for 3 bonfires (palindrome, mutations, seek and destroy) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evaristoc/fccgitterDataScience/master/figures/bonfsperday_helpchannel.png

The idea is to make a better chart with interactive capabilities.  

>---

###Last Week...:

* campersites visualization (@samosale's project)
* working on the Torrent Dataset in python

>---

###Who is in? (collaborations?)

* Same as last week

>---

* In the FCC News...:

* The graph above

>---

###... Next Week...:

* focusing on the projects already discussed in previous weeks
* issue about how to improve the information coming from the Torrent Dataset to be introduced

>---

###Wish List:

> creating small teams to analyse different aspects of the data and come every end of the month, for example, in order to put all our findings together for FCC to check"

I write content to another file and  deleted that script. Basically, because I don't know Regex very well, it was complicated with lots of loops, splits and replace methods.

Remember that node is async, so you have to work your callbacks in order to read those files externally.


About the loops: why do you have to iterate over the 25000 cities in the inside for loop? Can you organise that csv file so it becomes a json or similar so you can get any city by key? Still, you will need to read the files async, but the looping will be easier. I guess there should be a package that read a csv and converts it into a json or similar.

About your laptop: depends. I don't see that it is a lot of work for your computer, really. But this problem is more about CPU so you may have a slow down depending on your CPU power."

But I have some csv file of 25000 cities that are larger than 15000 and have geocoordinates. So I will do for loop on FCC list of cities. Inside of forloop I  need another for loop that will iterate over 25000 cities to find match and append cordinates. I never done that before, could my laptop cope with that iteration?

For those who might try to open the Torrent dataset with python:
My version of of the dataset came as a line-by-line file; the best way to read it in my case was by using either readlines or readline methods.
You could then use the json library to read it all but you need to get rid of the no-json characters at the beginning and the end of the line you want to read (eg. the inline character).

NOTE: it is huge! So far I needed 9.0 GiB of memory just to open it. I have enough memory for one reading, but if you don't you would have read it in bunches... Perhaps this can help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/519633/lazy-method-for-reading-big-file-in-python

I couldn't stop finding material... this time more about Learning Analytics with special attention to Learning Management Systems (or LSMs, the SaaS of the online education, eg Udemy):

https://salvetore.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/analytics-getting-helpful-information-out-of-an-lms/

https://www.successfactors.com/content/dam/successfactors/en_us/resources/brochures-product/learning-analytics.pdf

http://www.slideshare.net/m1ch43lw1ld3r/understanding-student-learning-using-learning-management-systems-andbasic-analytics

And for a more recent one:
http://www.lambdasolutions.net/resources/press/learning-management-system-reporting-analytics-launch/

The market for APIs with analytical purposes is worth exploring... 

>---

Also not long time ago I made available some articles about trends in Online Education, with growth estimations of about 25% the next 5 years, reaching an industry value of about $8 billions by 2018.

>---

I recently found out that here in Amsterdam there is a LSM (studytube.nl) that is looking for developers with experience in angular and, although very much based on RoR, they appreaciate some knowlegde of nodejs... so: for those interested in exploring the sector... The company seems to be going through an interesting moment..."

##THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:

> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

[Previous Digest](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56b0967b80ad69394a7be624)

>---

**Hi EVERYONE!**

* Question: who have been playing with the dataset recently? Talk about your results here!
* Remember there is an issue opened with possible projects (#6387); also the @vicky002's list!
* Those who are interested in mapping techniques or automating data capture should contact @hallaathrad offering help

>---

###Last Week...:

* @qmikew1's opinions about how to use Ubuntu datasets
* discussion about the applicability of fraud detection for FCC case: is it feasible/worthy? What to do instead?

>---

###Who is in? (collaborations?)

* I am focused on collecting data about bonfires and focusing on making an analysis of difficulty, to provide advise to campers about how to face them; data sources are Gitter chatrooms, Google Analytics; planning a pair of charts for an article at medium...
* it would be useful if someone can extract specific data from the Torrent dataset for the code comparison project...

>---

###In the FCC News...:

Possibly something about fraud detection or similar... not found yet...

>---

###... Next Week...:

* focusing on the projects already discussed in previous weeks

>---

###Wish List:

> creating small teams to analyse different aspects of the data and come every end of the month, for example, in order to put all our findings together for FCC to check

Whether you're using similarity or heuristics (though I'd agree the former would be more effective -but costly - (kind of like if you submit a paper it (or part of it) is part of 'the matrix of fraud detection')) you're evaluating against (first) a larger data set. I'm just saying that running these comparisons on 'red flag' (e.g., time of completion variable) first would be low hanging fruit. In @jameswinegar example 'already have the knowledge so, went very quickly on (x)' isn't unreasonable (for that example); however, just because it that would be higher in the queue order (based on whichever method) to evaluate doesn't detract from anything. 
55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2016-02-05T10:30:59.570Z	5586719a15522ed4b3e23add	evaristoc	56b479e36002fae41579f8c0	"@qmikew1 although the core team is managing time of completion as a variable, I also agree with @jameswinegar that time is not necessarily the best measure. Also as he mentions we must be wise when to use these techniques and what for. So far the people who have been claiming certifications have been honest with their work. It is possible that the experiment we are going into is more for making the evaluation more efficient. 

@qmikew1 I am adding to @jameswinegar post above that the idea is to keep it simple for the time being, something that allows a first scan under certain circunstances. @ChristianBertram is interested in working on a first approach. If @luishendrix is still interested in making an sketch of a comparison tool, perhaps Christian can join us in preparing the exercise.

Again: it is demonstrative. It is usually how it works: we make a demo, and ask for feedback. "

The underlying assumption that ""everyone is trying to finish the cirriculum"" is flawed in these cases."

People:
Who is REALLY interested in (simple!) fraud detection algorithms? There is a possibility that FCC would implement an *academic honesty enforcement workflow* policy.

I have suggested similarity analysis, but because an exhaustive comparison could be expensive, it would be better to implement an heuristic. I don't remember which the basic is, I think it had something to do with naive Bayesian, I am not sure."

Talked to Quincy: he won't give up the authorizations for FB and Twitter for any data mining activity. Security reasons. But I think you can still register as a developer in any of those and try to do some data mining on FCC information from your own account.

Forgot to mention: other interesting source of data about FCC available to us is GitHub."

In any case, even estimating activity using the database is not so simple as it looks like: there should be people who are still *register* but *not active*. Similarly, there are those who are active but are not captured in our systems because they are working in projects like ziplines or basejumps.

The *rough estimation* I have suggests that the last two days we might have had **10000-20000 active users**.

I have requested to add additional info about registered users to the Torrent dataset.

The last phrase:
> that is to say the patterns in responses could somewhat confirm the question validity as well

in theory, yes. You expect some redundancy that could become a pattern in some cases, but Natural Language Processing is a bit hard: precision could be low because that redundancy is not that good.

""Questions"" can be represented as a question (""?"") or as a request (""hey! I need help for this!"") for example. In short, you can communicate the same using different phrases. Then you have a lot of misspellings, etc... that we understand but the machine not...

If the ubuntu you are using is annotated (ie pre-classified), that would be great! You can use it for comparisons for sure...

The common practice when you have pre-classified data is going for a supervised method. Generally speaking consists in:
1) Get a small classified section of the dataset to use for training
2) Get another classified section for test
3) Apply a classification model on the first, and then use the test one to verify how good your model is

(I don't remember if the ubuntu dataset was annotated though...)

I can definitely see (though not well versed in python) the overhead in processing (i.e., the [loops](https://gist.github.com/evaristoc/3edec1ac7cfc602d4e93) on user (then multiplied out across over all users) in this... as an aside, I wonder if capturing responses from one user name to another matching a question origin (or hit) would be helpful --- hey you just posted while I was writing this lol

Everyone is welcome to participate with discussions, links, etc but

###For those who are interested in real hands-on experiences:

Just remember that the current dataset in Academic Torrent is **not** the only place to find *real* data to play with:
* this chatroom, and any chatroom in Gitter is of public access (be nice!)
* I will be talking to Quincy to give us some access to FCC Twitter and FCC Facebook (be nice!)
* FCC has publications in medium, quora, etc to get data from
* codepen: you should ask for authorisation though, because the only way to get data from codepen is scraping; please consult with me if you are interested

Although there already exists a couple of projects that do that, **we are not encouraging scraping on FCC pages** because scraping is currently putting a lot of pressure on FCC databases. Only one project is supported  that scrap in a regular base (@roelver's ""top100""). So, unless you are planning a small project with low impact (eg. @luishendrix92's ""Solution Getter""), it is better not to try scraping, much less in a regular base. If you still want to go ahead with some scraping, please allows us to have a look to the project before implementing it. Be nice!

You can come up with new ideas, projects, etc. Doesn't have to be FCC, but it would be nice if you incorporate JS in your project. You decide what part of the JS stack you want to include. I have a personal interest on d3js and web dev fundamentals with special interest in backend (MEAN stack). However I discussed previously that d3js could be an overkill for small projects. Additionally angular (the A of MEAN) is not supported by FCC program any more. It is a question of preferences, so decide your JS path and go ahead!

###All type of levels and (almost) all type of projects are welcome!

You can add more projects and or more data you want to get into...

>---

**My personal path...**
Taking in consideration my level, expertise as well as the value of the information for FCC, *my personal* preferences at the moment are:
* **chatroom analysis**: foundations of social network analysis (SNA); user life cycle; speech acts; camper's performance
* **FCC dataset**: user life cycle; foundations of code submission analysis (I proposed a collaborative project to @luishendrix92); camper's performance (eg. report by @george-stepanek was a simple but nice one)
* **products**: interactive visualization tools; simple recommenders or indexes; currently proposed for the hackaton a registration and evaluation app (user stories: a peer-to-peer evaluation section and a resolution time evaluation section, with leaderboards) that is being worked by @jbmartinez
* **others**: Google Analytics; I have a special interest on social-minded topics (environment, health, wealth, etc); also communication to large audiences through articles (falling closer to digital journalism)"

The main interest of the room is to ask people to come up with projects and create products, facing the usual challenges of data manipulation, preparation and presentation. Using JS is encouraged because this is part of the FCC program, but you can decide in which point of your project you will apply it. For example: I would like to develop my visualization skills with d3js.

@mutantspore has been more in the web dev than me; I have a more data analyst orientation, with more experience in the market research sector, but foundations in Data Science in general. The last 6 months I have been trying to combine that knowledge with some web development experience, mainly data manipulation and data visualization, as well as functional and event-driven programming.

@ChristianBertram @jorgon1022 we have data available, as @mutantspore mentioned. The data is about campers. There are some proposed  questions to be answered using that data. I am also asking to include other variables, to make it more informative.

We have also a small group of (busy) people working on the layout of a hackaton, but focused on FCC curriculum for now.

Have to go but you are welcome to come up and check the data! There are people who have already contributed with something.

Ideas, interests, projects, etc... always welcome!"

##THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:
> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

[Previous Digest](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56a6006c80ad69394a7a4a3d)

>---

Hi EVERYONE!
* Question: who have been playing with the dataset recently? Talk about your results here!
* Remember there is an issue opened with possible projects (#6387); also the @vicky002's list!
* Those who are interested in mapping techniques or automating data capture should contact @hallaathrad offering help

>---

###Last Week...:
* a public article I prepared about factors affecting the adoption of FCC project in medium freecodecamp was published
* this week I worked a [viz draft (exercise) to get an idea of campers' performance by using time per page GA data](http://codepen.io/ecccs/full/eJrdXK/); @krisgesling was a contributor
* @jameswinegar and @jbmartinez have been working on the hackaton
* I have been posting links related to a topic I find very exciting: DataScience advances in online education, particularly automated (AI-ish) solution evaluation - professors? teachers? ... -; planning a small related project
* a few post about what Data Science is, to remind you the generality of the definition
* @qmikew1 suggested a python library (csvfix)
* for those interested in computer-aided geography tools, @AdventureBear added a link about an ESRI event

>---

### Who is in?
* now that bonfires are no more, I am thinking in preparing an article about them, with visualizations. Who is in?
* inviting those who want to know more about d3js to improve the viz that @krisgesling and I have been working. **NOTE: CoreTeam has considered this information useful!**

>---

###In the FCC News...:

* I haven't thought what... ideas?

>---

###... Next Week...:

* focusing on the projects already discussed in previous weeks

>---

###Wish List:
* creating small teams to analyse different aspects of the data and come every end of the month, for example, in order to put all our findings together for FCC to check"

A presentation closer to what I was looking for is [in codepen](http://codepen.io/ecccs/full/eJrdXK/). 
###**I would like to invite the rest of you to modify it and improve it**.

There are things that can still be done, for example:
* The data contains also a ""visits"" variable (the number of visits counted by Google Analytics during the data time horizon). Showing number of visits could be useful to give some guidance about the reasons why Pairwise bonfire is rated as being solved ""faster"" than ""Spinal Tap"", for example. A good way to show the effect of visits is adding the y-axis in a form of a scatter plot BUT to keep the visualization rightly small by distinguishing patterns it would be better to make relevant transformations of the data to segment visits into *categories*. OBS: still it would be important to consider how to apply those transformations to make the data comparable **between regions** (desirable, but not required).
* You can add other statistics. d3js has some statistical functionalities. For example, can we get the average time for all selected challenges? BUT as an option, I would suggest to take in consideration the sample size (ie visits) for that calculation (it won't make the data more accurate in this case though...).
* There are some outliers in some graphs. I wouldn't eliminate them: I would pack them and indicate they are outliers very much at the end of the x-axis. Can you do that?
* Other functionalities? A better styling? I will ask @krisgesling to help me with mine, I am consider this project as a collaborative one.
* Can you change it from angular to react?

The target audience is not only other campers: This information is being shared with the Core Team and with those who are working in the curriculum, so they can have some ideas for possible improvements. We can eventually select the best of the projects (the best presentation AND the best data manipulation possible) as the standard to show this data in the future.

Hope you find this new extra-challenge interesting..."

###THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:

> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

[Previous Digest](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=569cd5943165a6af1a3c66c0)

Hi EVERYONE!

**Question**: who have been playing with the dataset recently? Talk about your results here!

>---

Last Week...:
* a *""Visualization"" Week*, with interventions from @dcsan, @AdventureBear, and mine
* @jameswinegar [comment over a question about tensorflow](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56a129fa5de13b3f15e472eb)
* the @vicky002's list is now an issue!
* excellent [comment by @qmikew1](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56a1369b59e3d04215bd25a6) about representative population

>---

Some Proposals:
--- @QuincyLarson suggested that [visualization and analyses contributions could be included in the FCC site](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=569e037fa03e28ad1adf8a34), so *feel free to participate!*
--- check also the @vicky002's list

>---

In the FCC News...:
* I mentioned several reviews about visualization and d3: I decided to include a link to the one discussing when d3 should be used: ""You may not need d3""

Please also check the @dcsan list of [chart libraries](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56a5758057ef8eae73f16bae)

>---

... Next Week...:
* focusing on the projects already discussed in previous weeks

>---

Wish List:
* creating small teams to analyse different aspects of the data and come every end of the month, for example, in order to put all our findings together for FCC to check"

If I am emphasising d3 is because I believe that I will learn more about event-driven programming, css/html and JS as well as getting better in interactive visualization techniques *all at once* if I follow that path, but **definitively**: no point to use d3 if what you need is just a traditional graph..."

While dedicating some time to learn d3.js (and the rest: html, css, JS, etc...) I have been wondering when d3.js is superior and when it is an ""overkill"". For example: I was primarely working on [this scatterplot](http://bl.ocks.org/evaristoc/1d19701fb9dfe5ecbbbc). I must say  that when static it was definitively easier in Excel than d3.js. I really started to appreciate some knowledge of the d3.js library after I started adding some interactive features... 

The fact is that If you are just working on something static or with pre-loaded capacities, d3.js seems to be too much coding... Even other programs, like python or R, could offer much better and nicer solutions at some point...

Although my main focus in the future will be d3.js, I was still asking myself about preferences between css/html+vanilla JS vs d3.js: when one is better than the other one? I feel I don't have the experience to answer that question. But for those who are more experienced with css/html or even vanilla JS,  I found this article very interesting: [""You may not need d3""](http://www.jeromecukier.net/blog/2015/05/19/you-may-not-need-d3/) --- the author also goes around a similar proposition for jQuery, suggesting vanilla JS could be sometimes more powerful..."

It has significantly more features than you will ever touch, but in the end they will be easier to implement than a solution based on sklearn and such. Really just a tradeoff of types of versatility at this point.

Not so much in the 'fun aspect' (i.e., users looking at leader for kicks), but in terms of application (possible and have no idea) to other trending?

I am using scikit-learn and R libraries but I have the impression that the tensorflow goes a bit beyond that, am I correct? Is there any other in use that worth exploring? For python...

It is annoying to compile and google has a lot of tendencies to make things hard. If it survives another year or so with reasonable commit rates then I'd work with it more.

For everyone:

I started also a couple of projects at http://bl.ocks.org/evaristoc. For people interested in how it works, let me know...

Also, to those interested in visualization as an specialization, this could be a sort of benchmark: https://medium.com/accurat-studio/beautiful-reasons-c1c6926ab7d7#.c94hgl299"

###THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:

> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

Hi EVERYONE!

*Did you know that...?* 100 words are enough for a challenge... https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=569c826204e908d302c3da92

**Question**: who have been playing with the dataset recently? Talk about your results here!

>---

Last Week...:
* Hack-Comm met; we worked on a first layout of the project: for more advances you can ask @jbmartinez, @jameswinegar or me
* @luishendrix92 [""Solution Getter""](http://codepen.io/luishendrix92/pen/JGrGmN?editors=101); code available at the data analysis folder of his github: go and fork it!
* @vicky002 has been also working on a similar but in python: show your code man!
* we discussed a possible bonfire comparison app, which would re-inforce what is taking place at the CodeReview room

>---

Some Proposals:
--- @vicky002 [list](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56975406da358920486e99ea)

>---

In the FCC News...:
* I mentioned several reviews about tech trends in online education:

[edtech](http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2014/12/10-online-learning-trends-watch-2015-infographic-0)

This is to share with you hints that could guide any data analysis on FCC data...

[tech](http://tech.co/7-hi-tech-education-trends-watch-2016-2015-12)

>---

... Next Week...:
* focusing on the projects already discussed

>---

Wish List:
* creating small teams to analyse different aspects of the data and come every end of the month, for example, in order to put all our findings together for FCC to check"

That would be emerging features, likely specific per bonfire... it won't be an exact thing: it is a *recommender*, so it will bring you to similar solutions to comparing...

Number of lines/characters doesn't seem like a ""similar"" indicator. Although there's probably some correlation. I can't think of a feature that would be easy though.

Something like, after pasting your code in a form as the @luishendrix92's codepen, the recommender could show SIMILAR solutions which could be ordered according to easy-to-get parameters, like length... Very much like: ""Check what other people using similar techniques as you did for this bonfire..."""

###THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:

> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

Hi EVERYONE!

First Digest of 2016!

Fantastic last 2 months, the DSR enjoyed an increase of 84% in number of subscribers compared to November last year. Welcome everyone!

**Question**: who have been playing with the dataset recently? Talk about your results here!

>---

Last 3 Week...:
* A first commission for the hackaton is in place; the members are @jameswinegar, @jbmartinez and me; we might add members to observe the process and come up with ideas; there are several proposals about how the hackaton could looks like...
* @george-stepanek already made [several analyses on the dataset](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56809b0d9606b15a055dd204); OBS: to check the dataset, you may need an editor of some kind able to manage large amount of records: @george-stepanek suggested Glogg http://glogg.bonnefon.org/
* Closely following issue #1022 made by @roelver to Gitter about limits imposed on Gitter API, which have been affecting data extraction; it is possible that Gitter will allow unlimited data extraction but pagination will be required

>---

Some Proposals:
--- @SYFReed abouth [creating infographics](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=56809c030171d1791d0254b0)
--- useful links by @AdventureBear (jsdatav.is/visuals.html), @carl-parrish (coursera's Data Science course), and @QuincyLarson (a podcast about Kaggle)
--- @quatridunull about [ideas for a hackaton, Kaggle style](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience?at=568c80a2262659750bce7821)

There are other proposals that we will be working as well... 

**Additionally**, I would like to propose that we, in the DSR, should make small teams to go through different aspects of the data. It is also possible that part of those findings could be suggested to FCC as a part of small articles for Free Code Camp Medium; authorship will be recognised

>---

In the FCC News...:
* Talking about Kaggle and JavaScript, here one of the Kagglers has produced something in [JavaScript for a Kaggle Competition: Clinton's emails](https://www.kaggle.io/svf/99857/cdb343ae63093b973d0b12ed6cdeae23/clintongraph.html), in d3.js... I am a Kaggle follower myself and had fun with a few of the Kaggle challenges (I am sure we can do even better!!!)

>---

... Next Week...:
* hackaton commission kick-off meeting
* @vicky002 will be invited to go ahead with one of his proposals
* re-working an application to follow up Gitter rooms that was started by @andela-bfowotade and me: looking for people who is interested

>---

Wish List:
* creating small teams to analyse different aspects of the data and come every end of the month, for example, in order to put all our findings together for FCC to check"

I think a hackathon like @jameswinegar and @evaristoc suggested for FCC Data Science students would be pretty cool. Maybe instead of having your standard weekend-with-no-sleep hackathon, we could do something like a month-long Kaggle challenge using Kaggle for classrooms or something similar, with data from FCC. For example, we could ask people to try to make a prediction of how many certificates someone will earn, or how long it will take to complete someone's first certificate, or some other such thing, based on data such as how long they have been on FCC, how often they complete challenges, how much they post in gitter, etc. And we can also add a secondary challenge for who has the most interesting and most well-designed data visualization of the dataset, showing any kind of trend they want. Then during the course of the challenge, also stream tutorials on FCC's channel for using all those python libraries and doing data vis and all that jazz. And maybe dedicate a day per week to have data 'hack nights' to all try to work on the dataset and be on the chatroom at the same time.

Looks like a pretty steep drop-off going into the basejumps! The Pomodoro and Twitch.tv challenges also look like significant hurdles -- maybe they need more/better hints?"

###THE DSR WEEKLY DIGEST:

> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

Hi EVERYONE!

Last Week...:
* @jameswinegar and me have been discussing how a hackaton organised by the DataScience room could looks like. We are looking for ideas and people who are enthusiastic to help with the organisation...
* @vicky002 has proposed to help with some data analytics for FCC...
* we are following up the progress of the update of the Gitter API to restore some capabilities to analyse data without a low limit; keep you all informed
* @AdventureBear is looking for inputs about an interesting visualization she has in mind; if you have some ideas that could work, share them!

In the FCC News...:
If you haven't seen it, go and check the work by one of our fellow FCC campers, @nicolanrizzo: [**a map of FCC groups**](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zH0hxoM17_fk.kDBMlxfk0BZ8)

... Next Week...:
* the digest goes on holidays - no digest in two weeks!

Wish List:
* hoping to have other fellow campers motivated to share and work together in projects and activities over data analytics and data science next year!"

Year as main x axis? Something different?

Why manual could be useful?
* Give you an idea of the procedure
* Allows you to catch some initial exceptions

For a more automated procedure, ideas:
* A conversion into a list, using the quote as a separator?
* possible with regex extraction; use start of sentence -> capture digits -> up to first quote and something similar for the second one. Be careful with exception and handling the errors then?
* I think there are JS libraries that manage that format, check a bit more the Date object....?"

R is a bit less problematic, although ggplot (a powerful graphic interface) looks rather another language. Matlab/Octave libraries don't normally pose transition issues: they are very consistent.

if you are interested in DataMining, ML, DataScience, etc, yes: you are better off by learning some python. I would start learning python first. But it is not the only option.

R is also an excellent option and you have a more statistical orientation. Matlab if you are interested in modelling / solving difficult derivative equations and it is also strongly used in finance/economics (where you will find a lot of applications of diff equations).

> *Note*: Be aware that ML and statistics share a common background. Although ML is more algorithmic-oriented, there is a point at which those algorithms are found in both fields to solve the same problems. I personally think that ML is a branch of statistics, although ML was developed mostly by CS and engineers.

Continuing with the languages...

R (in C++) is an statistics packages mainly made by staticians. python (in C) libraries are build by CS and mathematicians. Matlab has a more engineering tradition.

I have used all, although Matlab (actually Octave, Matlab's free software clone) a bit less. I prefer python because I find it substantially easier and faster than R, and easier in manipulating data structures than Matlab (strongly vectorised arrays and matrices as the atomic data structure).

python phylosophy is interesting here, very much Japanese style: most of the solutions that python offers are actually ""clones"" of previously existing solutions. numpy/scipy is somehow Matlab; pandas is somehow R. So by learning python correctly, you will have an introduction to the other two (except for the heavy use of anonymous functions in Matlab and some in R).

In R there is not a specific library to solve DatMin, ML problems: it looks more like JavaScript in that sense: there is a repository of solutions called packages. The difference to JS community is that all the solutions are peer-reviewed and should provide things like manuals to use the library, etc before being available to public.

In python, packages trend to be complete: scikit-learn is the current better known library for DM and ML; pandas is currently the most popular library for data manipulation. Normally, in the python community once a library catch up, everyone leave previous competing efforts and concentrate on that library, unless the developer believes is after something relatively different. Instead of adding different packages as in R, in python every new solution is build as a module of a popular existing library. Even more: successful projects are the base of other projects: example: numpy/scipy is the base of scikit-learn, nltk or pandas, and currently scikit-learn/nltk/pandas are made to work together. This helps to avoid redundancies (common in JS and R). The python trade-off to avoid stagnation of the modules (eg a better solution) is by usually providing boiler-plate: if you want more, you can easily do it but you have to code. In R it is much more difficult to change code; even more difficult with Matlab/Octave. But in R you are able to find better algorithms for specific tasks by looking for a different package.

Because R is made for statistics, it has a much better reporting feature. R used to have more powerful graphics setups than python (python is really catching up). R had more problems handling large amount of data. This is partly because R also assign numerous attributes to all classes that builds to facilitate the reporting, which in turn affects the available memory, but also because its main atomic data structure, the data.frame: it is not a real vectorised array. Things have changed since R introduced tables data structure about 5 years ago: I think tables are true arrays in the form of numpy/matlab arrays/matrices. python has also better approach to multiprocessing when required.

@jameswinegar correctly mentioned Scala (related to java).  I don't know Scala, but it has been the much popular option for heavy-weight tasks in the last 2-5 years for data manipulation and collection. Spark is a Data Mining / Machine Learning library and it is an spin-off of Hadoop-like solutions: it is a sub-language (java) that solves the IO problem posed by many map-reduce solutions by solving many tasks in memory instead. I have just glanced Spark, planning to study it later deeply... The Spark API for python is becoming very popular.

Hope this helps."

Scala is the language underpinning Spark which is the distributed compute engine of choice for most large scale ETL and Machine Learning. They have a python API that calls the underlying Scala from Python since it acts as an excellent wrapper language. If you want to add additional data types to the Spark engine you will need to know Scala to expand the library. Then use Python for the typical data analysis work in it where there exist a large library for performing data analysis.

About JS and ML: it is currently more for practising techniques

@jameswinegar: totally agree: I envision the hackaton as one that should contain elements about visualization and or back-end design... my prefered project would be to build a very simple but robust app... that could even have some python/C/etc as an additional featured language... we need to think further about it... I will keep getting inputs from you and everywhere...

> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

Hi EVERYONE!

Last Week...:
Several points:
* @roelver found changes in the Gitter API that affected his app and likely any other project based on that
* @johnlreavis, @P1xt, @jameswinegar, @carl-parrish were discussing some aspects we should consider when analysing FCC data
* some people have come up with questions about Data Science training: some campers, eg @carl-parrish, @wwwfredom and @darwinrc, have been providing help

In the FCC News...:
Although not strictly related to JS, one repo that is currently under @vicky002's

... Next Week...:
* No plans... hoping for answers about organising a hackaton for next year...

Wish List:
* No this week

The FCC DataScience community is growing. I was thinking if it wouldn't be a good idea if we organise a small hackaton for  locals and foreigners.
I don't have much experience with that and my current developer skills are still... well... developing... but I would like to hear some ideas and expertise we would like to share.
Mine since to be stronger in analytics. I have strong base in data mining and exercised some interesting projects in machine learning before. There is also a [small project](https://github.com/evaristoc/fccgitterDataScience/blob/master/Exploring%20the%20use%20of%20similarity%20scores%20to%20identify%20help%20requests%20in%20FCC%20chat.ipynb) I did here applying text analytics.
Other topic? @AdventureBear commented me she wanted to know more about scraping using JS.
I would suggest if any of you could:
* give his/her opinion
* suggest a topic
* indicate if wanting to be a possible facilitator
* indicate if being able to be part of a hackaton organization commission

Hoping to hear from you all"

These will apply to GPU’s as well. Possibly OpenMP and MPI depending on where you’re looking at it. 
55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2015-12-12T23:29:02.665Z	55bdbe8c0fc9f982beabd64e	roelver	566cadbe7eae7fe80e609783	@evaristoc @abhisekp I registered issue #1022 for this. https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter/issues/1022

I think it is a different level of data requirement though: bot is more about only usernames of few users required per events occurring in parallel at several rooms.
55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2015-12-12T23:13:56.549Z	55a40c8c5e0d51bd787b4329	carl-parrish	566caa34187e75ea0e485f01	@abhisekp I’m thinking of a way in our profile to say that we’ll allow shared use of data (sort of like we do with github) then allow that as a datapoint for how long it takes to get a zipline done for instance. Perhaps also add [rescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) to that list.

It could be not only you: we have another project that also downloads a lot of data through the API; we left the project unattended for a while until I checked it a few weeks ago: I found it was not capturing all data as before..."

I see you and others have prepared an outstanding collection of references in the repo AlgoWiki...

I imagine it can be hard to maintain... I don't have formal education as CS but for what I have seen so far, maybe things you would like to consider including/exploring in the future?
* R
* heterogeneous computing (I just know a bit of it, but it is being used a lot in advanced analytics settings)
* perhaps something about architectures (eg HDFS)
* I would make a space for julia
* No hadoop? cassandra? spark? kaftka? etc on your list?
* For basic knowledge, statistics and linear algebra, perhaps automatas
* Make a room for discrete optimisation...
* Make a room for computational statistics...

Check the following too:
* https://github.com/yaph/data-science-blogs
* https://github.com/evaristoc/awesome-machine-learning (a forked one...)
* https://github.com/evaristoc/algorithms.js (a forked one...)

Data Science is still a big term and difficult to frame... during my training with people at cloudera, we tried to arrive to a common definition and I think perhaps it is one that could be good for you too:
> ""the role of the data scientist is to provide the organisation with effective **data-related products**, contributing at any point of the data life cycle"" 
 
To get closer to a data scientist according to that definition, you should know not only about analysis but also data management, visualization, algorithms (very relevant!), etc... as well as having an idea of a particular field... 

Still the interpretation of what a Data Scientist does can change from one place to the other; some companies may post a position looking for a Data Scientist when in reality they are looking for a Data Reporter or an Engineer...

Despite having relevant training in advanced analytics and some experience working with large amount of data, I don't consider myself a data scientist yet... The field is huge and in my opinion the actual path to master it is long... success!"

You can either sign up for it (for pay) and get verified certificates or look up the courses individually and take them (unverified) for free. I used them to learn R (I'm about halfway through the sequence), they're top notch courses and each of them is pretty quick to complete. They estimate 1-4 hours per week for four weeks so 4-16 hours, I found that it took me around 6 hours per course if I really focused. They all run every month (I think) and just started yesterday. Here's the list https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhudatascience

Also in the FCC News, an article about [Wikipedia and AI](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/wikipedia-is-using-ai-to-expand-the-ranks-of-human-editors/) brought about by @QuincyLarson.

IMO, I would say: Don't be surprise when those techniques come part of the regular architecture of leading online education platforms...

For those interested in modelling and simulation, you can see [this reference](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/hikes?at=565f31479a969fd24f3c2cc6) suggested by @jameswinegar in another room... not JS... simulation is in many ways a step or consequence of data analyses...

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"

Though, I'm not sure how telling the result would actually be in those cases where one is primarily chatting as a means to gain assistance with the curriculum.

I for instance, could likely do all the base jumps in a day but have gone a week without doing any - not because I wasn't here and active, or because they're too difficult - solely because I decided to up my score on CodeWars instead as a bit of a break.
55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2015-12-06T20:08:47.247Z	5586719a15522ed4b3e23add	evaristoc	566495cf1da31ad605a927f3	"@johnlreavis yes... about experienced dev, I think it will be a bit harder to distinguish them a priori, although we are aware that the situation exists, indeed...
I think @SaintPeter was also referring to the fact that part of the tracing is incomplete for things like ziplines or basejumps because most of the actitivity occurs outside FCC.
Another thing is the constant change in the curriculum and the changes in deadlines: this year the curriculum has been changed at least 2 times...
And you are right, @johnlreavis: better to work on a sample... I don' t think that we need more people to complete the training before starting, but that would certainly help..."

Since you don;t need data in real time perhaps your requests don't even need to hit the DB and cache can be generated on cron jobs. Just an idea ..."

So it is definitely an aggregation of the user data in the FCC database. Running this aggregation in real time on the FCC database for 150k users could slow down/blow up the database I guess, so a daily extract would be fine. I'm not a Mongo guru but I can give it a try to write an export query.

> DSR (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

Hi EVERYONE!

Last Week...:
* showing and discussing the [codepen zipline indexer](https://ziplinesfcc.herokuapp.com/)

In the FCC News...:
* One about [Mobile Backend as a Service providers](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2842791/application-development/mbaas-shoot-out-5-cloud-platforms-for-building-mobile-apps.html), suggesting nodejs as one of the first selections for those type of  companies. I found this article interesting as the extensive use of nodejs could indirectly relate to its use as data collection tool. For example, camper @sudip007 also made available a link in the FCC News about [the use of nodejs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5062614/how-to-decide-when-to-use-node-js), and as many other sources confirm the  argument continues to be that nodejs is excellent for some kinds of data collection/transfer, particularly real time.

... Next Week...:
* Revisiting a pending analysis about the use of nodejs by companies and organizations
* Revisiting some data collected about zipline preparation...
* Revisiting the codepen zipline indexer

Wish List:
* No changes...

Regular List:
(Not today...)"

I would break the process into several steps, as independant files, and use something like SQLITE to store your common results.  SQLITE is super fast and lightweight and easy to intergate with Python.
Steps -
* Username Harvesting from Gitter  
This can be broken into chunks or batches.  Write the usernames and possibly a harvest date to a username table in your SQLITE file.
* FCC Profile Scraping   
Pull from the username table, grab chunks of usernames.  As you parse out ziplines capture the zipline name, the pen url (or just the pen ID), and the completion/submission date. Store these in a zipline table.  Write back to the username table the FCC harvest date and the number of ziplines completed.  These can be used to filter future pulls.  If a username comes back 404, mark this in the username table as well, so you don't waste time scraping it again.
* Codepen Scraping   
Pull from the zipline table to get the created date for each zipline, as well as the tags.  Add this back to the zipline table.
* Data Output   
Take the contents of your two tables and combine them to generate a flat file or flat database to display on the web and/or run data analysis on.  Do date delta calculations, etc, here, before things are output.

The bottom line here is to reduce the total work that any one script is doing and to reduce/remove repition of work.  You can also parralleize or batch each of these script runs.  Use the database tables to keep track of your work as you go, setting booleans or date/timestamps to prevent duplication of effort.

With my current scrap problems could be:
* Not all complete pens will show
* Some pens will be redundant (forks) and other pens will be incomplete jobs
*  Not always possible to get the FCC username, which could be different at codepen

For the time being offering usability while keeping implementation costs low is something I can live with... As long as the project is useful enough, I could live with those ""problems"".  In any case, I am expecting that the benefit will be still higher than the aforementioned if people find that it is easy to search other existing projects... 

What I would like to solve though is the username: that will be definitively a good thing to have... I wonder if I can find a way to find a solution that is not so IO-intensive (I am not sure it this is the correct term, I meant: I used a sample of users but to download all pages that would have been more than 3GiB of data in web pages...).

* About the scraping procedure, that is exactly what I did for the python one (ie the analysis)! Veeerryyyyy sloow and a LOT of data to visit (every camper, probably not having ziplines)...
* So... left with a simpler way for the codepens: search page by page for ""freecodecamp"" (at least those who are indexed under ""freecodecamp"" are known to have something to do with it...): only 4000+ pens at the moment at codepen.io.
* I haven't load the script yet for the analytical part... I will do it tomorrow. For the app: https://github.com/evaristoc/zipline_fcc2. It was a couple of days coding (finally I am ENJOYING coding with MEAN; but guess what!? We are moving to react! - ... yuppi...)

That is one of the things I found useful from @roelver's top100: I managed to get into some good basejumps, for example, and check solutions to issues I had with mine... I would like to replicate that utility but for ziplines and help other campers to choose some that could help them to verify other campers' solutions.

I am still for a simple solution... this scrap seemed not so data-intensive as the other one... Other thing I noticed was that the node scrap was apparently faster than the other one, made with python libraries... but too early to compare both...

Anyway: at least it is a start...
Hey: can you have a look at the app I prepared? It is very a draft. Also although it is not clearly stated you can also sort the data by some of the columns... Let me know *how you think that could work for you*? I am interested in the utility first... "

>**DSR** (DataScience Room) is an effort to gather campers of all levels and specializations willing to engage in discussion, collaboration and practice of data-related projects with focus on JS and FCC.

Hi EVERYONE!
*Do you know that…?* It is possible that the median of days to prepare a zipline could be about **8 days** with a minimum of 1 day (just deployed) and maximum of 341 days. The data is based on a complex, drafted scrap that took data from FCC and then from codepen sites using a random list of 10000 campers obtained from gitter FCC room. The number of days are calculated as the difference between the creation date and the modification date that was available at the camper's pen at codepen.io at the time of the scrap. pens with created and modified dates were considered as *complete observations* (*co*); other pens for which no date could be captured or with only created date were not included in the analysis. If pens with only created date would have been added as valid observations, the calculated values would substantially decrease, giving an overall median of 3 days to prepare a zipline.

Bellow you can see the data splitted per zipline:

Show the Local Weather: **13 days**  (max:  122 d, co: 161, sampled: 346)
Build a Pomodoro Clock: **8 days** (max:  204 d, co: 120, sampled: 322)

Build a Wikipedia Viewer: **6 days** (max:  31 d, co: 21, sampled: 56)

Build a Simon Game: **7 days**  (max:  35 d, co:  26, sampled: 62)
Use the Twitchtv JSON API: **10 days**  (max:  68 d, co: 49, sampled: 131)

>The script will be published at the DSR repo. I would also like to thank gitter, codepen.io and FCC for providing the data for all these projects.

... *The Last Week*…:
*A first workable draft of a Zipline Indexing is available at [this link](http://ziplinesfcc.herokuapp.com/). This project is inspired in @roelver's top100 but considered a simplified approach for scrapping. The target data is the more than 4000 pens that are indexed under the keyword ""freecodecamp"" in codepen.io. However, there are still some issues with the scrapping and only 350 pens are currently available. The project is open for collaboration.
*In the News*…:
*A simple but intuitive visualization made by a Swedish online news channel, SVT Pjel. The report is in Swedish. The visualization is about the [number of Syrian refugees by country](http://pejl.svt.se/syriska-flyktingar-per-land/) during 2014. The link is in FCC News under the title: ""DSR recommends: Viz of the Syrian Refugee Crisis, 2014 - in Servian, but intuitive..."".
NOTE: I mistakenly wrote ""Servian"" instead of *Serbian*. Sorry about that: it is obvious I don't speak ""Servian"", Serbian or Swedish myself...

... *Next Week*…:
* Still no plans… Ideas?

*The Wish List*…:
* Comparing the methodology used for the text analytics project with a different method, and possibly adding other case study (i.e. camper)
* Broader analysis of the effectiveness of Gitter as part of the FCC's Learning Platform
* Attrition analyses in some of the gitter rooms
* The survey project is idle… we were looking for another person to join the project...

Hi EVERYONE!

(in the fixed list - *let me if you want to be part or not of this list*:
@BerkeleyTrue, @QuincyLarson, @dcsan, @benmcmahon100

*... The Last Week…*:
* I got approval from **CodePen to practice a scraping over their pages**. The idea is to work a demo project that would resemble the @roelver's top100 but focused on the progress of some of the Ziplines, extracting information currently not available in FCC databases. **The project is open for collaboration**… They also suggested the [following project](https://github.com/TimPietrusky/codepen-awesomepi)

*In the News…*:
* Garret Allen explored the use of [nodejs in a data mining](http://garrettallen.com/2013/04/16/data-mining-with-nodejs.html) project --- dated 2013… also available at FCC's News.

*... Next Week…*:
* Focus on CodePen project

*A Wish List…*:
* I am in the mood of **comparing the methodology used for the [text analytics project](https://github.com/evaristoc/fccgitterDataScience/blob/master/Exploring%20the%20use%20of%20similarity%20scores%20to%20identify%20help%20requests%20in%20FCC%20chat.ipynb)** with a different method, and possibly adding other case study (i.e. camper)
* I am preparing some room in my agenda to take the methodology by @roelver to be used for a broader **analysis of the effectiveness of Gitter as part of the FCC's Learning Platform**
* We have enough data to start **attrition analyses in some of the gitter rooms**; we have already explored a methodological approach in [previous study](https://github.com/evaristoc/fccgitterDataScience/blob/master/Users%20by%20Active%20Use%20and%20Frequency.ipynb)
* The **survey project** is idle… we were looking for another person to join the project...

*NOTE*: I will be travelling next week so we will resume activities second week of Nov"

Our eventual goal is to incorporate @roelver’s awesome leaderboard into Free Code Camp itself. We want to build a “follow” mechanism, and your leaderboard will show you VS the people you’re following. Runkeeper and a few other apps use these “localized” leaderboards, and they’re quite fun and effective.

------------------------------------------

No *Did you know that…?* this week
**There is and issue (#3589(https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/3589)) recently opened by Quincy**

------------------------------------------

**Quick Report**:
[*DA app*](https://github.com/andela-bfowotade/fcc-da-frontend/tree/fcc-da-backend):
@andela-bfowotade
* No changes
* PURPOSE: practical exercise for data analysis in Javascript, with relevant data

[*Chat Room Analysis*](https://github.com/evaristoc/fccgitterDataScience):
* analysing text: an analysis and some conclusions are provided at [this link](https://github.com/evaristoc/fccgitterDataScience/blob/master/Exploring%20the%20use%20of%20similarity%20scores%20to%20identify%20help%20requests%20in%20FCC%20chat.ipynb)
* we stop looking for a help-request classifier for now
* PURPOSE: to answer the questions about participation in Gitter

*Infographics and Data Visualization*:
* the data for the visualization is being revised to offer another type of information
*PURPOSE: training in data visualization techniques

*Survey*:
@SaintPeter
* no advances in this project
* PURPOSE: practical exercise using basejumps, to collect demographics

------------------------------------------

**In the News...**:
* this week, a link about [web-scraping using nodejs](https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js); this and the work by @roelver would be source of inspiration for projects in the near future

------------------------------------------

**This Week...**:
*DA App*:
--- currently reading about redis
--- other improvements

*Chat Room Analysis*:
--- @roelver's work demonstrated how easy is to scrap some data; that suggests that there are ways to explore the relations between camper's performance and chat participation; this has been formerly commented with @SaintPeter and @ArielLeslie

*Infographics and Data Visualization*:
--- some few ideas in progress

*Survey*:
--- idle"

I guess you iterate over the whole list of 16k members? I would like to have an idea of performance... I have been working on another thing wih @andela-bfowotade (getting the data from the chat and counting the messages per day) but performance is problematic. Thinking about complementing with a db (redis).

And whenever possible encouraging teams to work on those.

Sort of an reference place to come and learn or see what it is about Javascript and data, from capture to viz. No-one have to be fully into data, but just taking that part that may interest you more, as long as it has to do with data in particular. Hope we can make it strong and sustainable... let's see..."

**In the News...**:
For those who are interested in trying your own infographics without using one of the templates that exist out there, I found [this link](http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/animated-infographics-with-html-css-jquery/); there are many online courses and tutorials, but I think lynda.com (paid) is offering good resources; for the html environment, d3.js is the most recommended tool (quora).

------------------------------------------

**This Week...**:
*DA App*:
--- currently reading about redis
--- other improvements

*Chat Room Analysis*:
--- more work on text analysis
--- verifying the use of other techniques (for example using Multidimensional Scaling)

*Infographics and Data Visualization*:
--- currently reading some tutorials about and piping some few ideas

*Survey*:
--- in progress"

I have been trying very simple techniques with verbose python to check if translating from python to JS makes sense.

The purpose of the text mining project at the moment is not considering sentiment analysis: only ""speech act"", particularly finding questions and requests for help, but also beginning and end of conversations. In the last part of project (this week) I tried a lazy, instance-based analysis comparing ""distances"". A methodology similar to k-NN where k is the whole training dataset. The training dataset I have been using is a popular corpus. I was using it to compare composition and the same corpus modified to compare sentence structure, to get two measures. Then I just quickly checked if there were regions in the ""scatter plot"" of those distances that better grouped the targeted sentences.

I was using a small sample with data from one of the campers mentioned in the DataScience list above and the results were promising, although still with some caveats.

The results hasn't been published yet. I would like to find time to compare to other technique first. I am afraid I will have to use more python capabilities for that...

@qmikew1 The general idea of the room is also to invite people to be proactive by presenting/joining small projects? Projects can be a week long, and the only requirement would be that JS should be used at some point.  It is not compulsory: you can just simple check room progress: you have been in the list for some time, so feel free to do as you want, ""advisoring"" is also fine."

*Did you know that…?* If we define being **OFF** from the chatroom if the user waits more than 5 minutes or more to send the next message, being **ON** if the user sent messages during the period before being considered off, and assume the time for any first message to add 1 minute, we could say that in the Help room (again, Jan/Jul 2015):
* There were around 19000 ON actions, including those that consisted in just 1 message.
* There were about 8500 users who sent a message and went OFF after sending it.
* The maximum continuous time being ON was about 3 hours.
* The average ON time was 4.6 (*OBS*: likely affected by the definition)

*OBS*: This calculation is not about actual communication with someone: the data is about *each* user. Actually the data for one room won't be necessarily the same for others. But it help to characterize the communication in the different chats according to the topic, importance and utility of the chat rooms and add more information about dynamics.

* @dcsan: you are right, but not having access to login I am measuring those who send *at least one message per day*. **The measure is a daily one**.
* I am measuring **active** as sending at least a message at any day.
* I also give 15 days (arbitrary, based on experience) of no sending message to classify them as *no-active in the room* (they could still be active in FCC, be active in another room, or be passive users, we don't know yet) and defining the **frequent use** as sending messages during 5 days or more. You can say this is not a retention measure as you mentioned above, but an activity measure.

It seems that:
* Many people came during that period just to post one or more messages during less of 5 different days (no frequent) and became no-active in *that room* afterwards.
* It seems that there was a small fraction of the group of people who came back and were actively participating in the Help room (possibly the helpers?).

Anyway, as I mentioned, there are a lot of ""invisibles"". I am personally not sure if an event-driven capture of data from the bot using google analytics will supply more info about no-actives, but certainly will let us know if those who are active are using the bot. I am not sure though... I think both analyses would give us a better picture about how *some* people use Gitter, but at the moment there is no info about *all* people using **FCC**. "

@cdikibo hasn't been involved much in the project due to problems with her computer that it has taken her about 2 weeks long.

-- We found some small issues and we dedicated the time to them: we were discussing the best way to organise files and today I was working on normalising the date representations of the data, to allow for future comparisons. In the next few days I will still present a first demo through C9. Let you know.

*Text Mining*:
-- In the few hours, between today and tomorrow I will load the results of a (very small) test of classification of randomly selected sentences from the Help room using nltk and the **nps chat corpus**.
-- Additionally I am working on a modification of the ubuntu chat corpus, in particular the **bot-answerable questions (BAQ) corpus**, in order to see if by making it more generic in its content, we can improve its precision. I will be also using the factoids list that comes with the corpus to modify the content of what we are considering as utterances (visit wikipedia). The modified file is ready but still not available.
-- The plan is to combine both corpora, the nps chat and the modified BAQ corpus, to check if that approach is good enough to capture tech questions in Gitter rooms.
-- There are some relevant challenges and ""discoveries"" about my last analysis that I could happily share with you if you want.

*Survey?*:
-- There is a proposal for carrying out a simple survey in the Gitter channels to collect demographic data. The proposal was mentioned to @BerkeleyTrue.

*News*:
-- Since this week we are weekly loading links in the News of FCC about topics that talk about JavaScript and its role in data analysis and data science. This week: **""Big Data and Nodejs""**. Serve yourself.

*Did you know that…?* If we consider that a person becomes **no-active in Gitte Help room** (ie. doesn't show activity) if they don't send any message after 15 days of their last participation, we got that 721 of the total participants (1726) in the Gitter FCC/Help room wer considered active when observing activity during 2014-12-30 and 2015-08-16. Similarly, if we assume that a participant is a **frequent**  one if he/she has at least 5 messages at different days, that number is drastically lower: *only 308 people were considered as frequent visitors*, visiting Gitter Help room to an average rate of 42% of the all days between their first and last message, being the longest stack 83 days long.

The data above should be cautiously manipulated: there are sure lots of *invisibles*: for example people who are *passively* visiting Gitter (eg. those who come just to read). There are other factors that affect the presence of users at Gitter rooms. That doesn't make the information useless. Data of this kind is useful if you can find that it is ""stable"" or a ""signature"" of a particular room, and you want to see if some changes ""disturb"" that stability."

55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2015-09-08T04:55:46.437Z	558b9bd615522ed4b3e2b0f4	dting	55ee6a52f86e90e11d5d91dd	@evaristoc Thats actually not a set. Thats a list. You could make that a set using `{...}` instead of `[...]`using a list instead of a set makes that lookup `O(n)` instead of `O(1)` so thats probably a significant difference. 
55bb9cab0fc9f982beabafce	FreeCodeCamp/DataScience	2015-09-07T17:00:56.990Z	5586719a15522ed4b3e23add	evaristoc	55edc2c897535f4058efb267	"Yes, @abhisekp, but for me it was a quick way to find the punctuations from the string module (I just found that reference) and comparing as a set. There would be issues with regex like '...' or other things that I didn't want to give it a thought.

But the more you really want to clean or get more relevant info, or the more you want to code away from the nltk library, the more you would rely on direct regex to do some work... (there should be a lot of regex in the nltk library...)"

This week the team was not totally available (sickness, other issues). Additionally, @Lightwaves has expressed that he won't be able to continue working as part of the active team, busy with the school. He has done a great job! Thanks, @Lightwaves!
*DA app*:
--- we worked on extending the app to include data from several rooms.
--- the project is progressing quite well and we are happy to recognise the help from other people:
------ @biancamihai gave some important clues on how to implement an async functionality and we would be in conversations for a potential implementation of a database and a deamon for scheduled data updates
------ @abhisekp worked a reduce that was giving me headaches and guided a comparison with what it is done with the camperbot to get data from the rooms

*Text Mining*:
--- the project as conceived is still behind and now we are less people working on it, but it got a special reference in the *Did you know...* section

*Other projects/ideas*:
--- @SaintPeter's random thoughts:
* correlations between Gitter activity about challenges vs solved challenges
* Gitter utilization rate
* surveying people to get more data about user performance and characteristics; use the information to improve service

--- @ArielLeslie's peanut gallery come-ups:
* FCC plans for open data: when? how? which format? (possibly a question for @BerekelyTrue)
* suggestion for how to analyse that data: logstash, elasticsearch; status of the data (sanitation? cleaned?)
* (also @SaintPeter) databased? --> some ideas of data attributes to load (date, etc)
* attrition analysis (*my note: it can be calculated to some extent and that would be for next edition of this report*)
* community involvement and categorization of users according to that
* campers' types, based on data available
* finding pairing based on progress level, like at  Words With Friends (*my note: Interesting...*)
* user performance indicators (also @SaintPeter)

--- @Lightwaves' suspicious sounds:
* unsupervised learning (clustering) for user characterization

--- @qmikew1's idea...:
* opening a Security-related room (*where is that room??*)

@abhisekp, @biancamihai, @Lightwaves, @AdventureBear, @SaintPeter, @mildused, @ArielLeslie, @qmikew1

*Did you know that...?*
* In the set that we are still analysing (ie. the Help channel Jan-Jul 15) there are about 1.6 mill words and punctuation signs, counting all messages. The data is raw: this is including also links, code-related lines, etc.
* Just analysing the raw data we still wanted to find some important bigram collocations (**bigrams**: set of paired words; **collocations**: expressions of multiple words which commonly co-occur). I used two mixed samples with different sizes. After some treatment to the text (*tokenization*), words that trended to appear together were:
 * proper names of food, places or objects (eg ""penaut butter"", ""eiffel tower""); 
 * proper names of programming tools or programming concepts (eg. ""regular expressions"", ""action hero""); 
 * and of course, some bonfires names (eg. ""chunky monkey"").  
 However the results between samples seemed to be different because the methodology used relies a lot on sample size. No larger sizes were used because the algorithm to calculate collocations is CPU intensive and was taking too much to evaluate the full set. This is just exploratory.
* We could evaluate bigrams for all the dataset. Although also exploratory, we went through detecting bigrams with the word ""**bonfire(s)**"". There were at least over 700 bigrams with the word ""bonfire(s)"" after eliminating some stopwords and punctuation signs. Below I listed the most frequent ones in reverse order. The result shows the potential and challenges of closing the gap to detect relevant words in an specific context.

I would like to see the attrition rate as well . . . I'm sure it's a nice power curve drop-off.
But you can filter for ""active users"" or something
I know that the data is going to be noisy as heck.  It would be interesting to classify users in certain ways:  For example, someone who is an ""expert"" coming in would complete LOTS of early waypoints very quickly.
Someone who is a genuine novice may only complete a few a day
I think that we might be able to tease these sort of relationships out and be able to group users into rough categories.
Then we can see how far each type gets, which problems send them to he help rooms, etc.
There is also going to be noise from broken tests as well.""

Actually, those type of questions were the reason why Quincy and Berkeley opened this room. Other questions are related to the bot.

The purpose is to get there... But we are also busy trying to do something more FCC-ish: building a small app in JS for presenting the data...

@BerkeleyTrue, @QuincyLarson, @dcsan, @benmcmahon100 
@Lightwaves, @cdikibo, @andela-bfowotade 
@abhisekp, @biancamihai 

*Did you know that...?* According to our data, during Jan-Jul 2015 there were around 1700 people that produced 75000 messages in the Help channel. That means approx. 6.25 messages per person. However, the top 5 participants produced together more than 10500 messages (a 14% of the messages). Want to guess who took the 4th and 5th places? Hints: the 4th is a well known FCC member with a big memory size, and the 5th is considered a Saint by many for all his help...

**Quick Report**:
* This week half of the team was inactive (occupied with other issues)
* DA app:
--- we managed to complete a first test for getting the data from one room through our (amateur...) backend and pass it to the frontend (ufff! hurra!) (https://github.com/andela-bfowotade/fcc-da-frontend/tree/fcc-da-backend)
--- separately, we worked on a first sketch of how the frontend could look like (https://github.com/andela-bfowotade/fcc-da-frontend/tree/ui-update); we are thinking on one, maximum two pages site for the time being
--- this week other people have been contributing, or would like to in the future, mostly in the form of ""consultants""
--- we are analysing the inclusion of a DB in the background to keep some data and not to overuse the API's to render it; we are evaluating the use of SQL and or redis
* Text Mining:
--- this project is unfortunately behind, and because its requirements it will progress slowly; this project is also difficult to put forward within the FCC programme as it is now
--- given above, we are reducing the current scope for the time being to an exploration project, with small validation- and test datasets
--- I made relevant progress in data preparation, and a method for data annotation, but the files are not ready yet
--- we are going to concentrate on *testing the use of 2 foreign annotated corpora for the detection of the enquiring questions in help-related channels*

**Next Week...**:
* DA app:
--- try to get data from different rooms (at least the Help-related ones)
--- try to make the first tests with the connected endpoints, and explore the use of an option feature to navigate through the data visuals
* Text Mining:
--- prepare and share the files for annotation (between 1500 and 3000 sentences will be evaluated)"

Project Aurelia-guides designed to extract the valuable information from the https://gitter.im/Aurelia/Discuss chat room. Aurelia-Guides is my answer to very frequent problem where the software developers never get enough time to create the documentation with the sufficient details to make their product easy to use - the product in this concrete situation being [Aurelia Framework}(http://aurelia.io/). One of the key innovations in this project is the creation of the context in the chatroom, where the folks providing answers in the form of the chat, can also ""persist"" this context in a searchable database, being available to anyone who will have the same problem at a later time. It is the creation of this context that led me to you as you already did something similar with a slightly different goal."

Hi everyone:
Did you know that...?: *The busiest day of the week in the Help channel during the period Jan-Jul 2015 could have been Tuesday? According to our data that difference was not specially big when compared to other working days but Friday. The users could have been relatively less active Fridays and Saturdays (party and family time...)*
-- Sun: 10290 
-- Mon: 11686
-- Tue: **12147**
-- Wed: 11465
-- Thr: 11370
-- Fri: 9649
-- Sat: 9455

**Quick Report**:
* We have a first sketch of the frontend and backend for a full JS online dashboard. Both sections worked at test. You can find the code at https://github.com/andela-bfowotade/fcc-da-frontend/tree/fcc-da-backend repo (fcc-da-backend branch).
* There is some progress regarding the classification project; I made few small tests and started getting used to the NLTK tools. I also made up what could be the methodology for a first trial. However it could require some ""manual labour"". Manual Labour seems to be a resource that would constrain the project scope.
* Finally, some of the previous issues with the current set-up (i.e. C9, python access, etc) have been solved; we are waiting for @cdikibo to solve some technical problems to fully join the team"

**Just a FYI**: we are planning to clone a bit your REST API javascript code to get data from the rooms. We are likely including all the rooms in the near future to prepare some statistics, so we are following your lead in that regard too... I believe we can ignore socket.io: I think an async.parallel would be enough for this project...

@Lightwaves and me will be working on it... we will try not to disturb you (too much...)..."

I can try to investigate though... I wonder if @QuincyLarson, @BerkeleyTrue, or someone else at FCC has access to numbers of that kind...

Still it could be a misleading number: we actually don't know exactly who/how many of those who are joining a chat room are actively participating... some of them could be even registered in FCC but not being active in the whole programme any more.

I have experience in doing customer analytics... I wonder if we can apply some life cycle techniques to try to estimate that...

However what I think we can try to do is to look for any correlation with the data @QuincyLarson mentioned above at the kick-off of this chat room:
> Google indexes all of Gitter's messages
> open up our entire anomyzed dataset

In that way, we can also estimate (roughly...) some impact over the progress of the students...

By the way: @BerkeleyTrue and @andela-bfowotade: letting you know that @cdikibo will be joining the group; we have already discussed the scope of this project on the phone and where she can contribute.

WEEKLY REPORT:
* General installations have required small fixes and permissions; we are considering the current format as good enough for the project period but it wouldn't be sustainable if the period is extended
* No classification has been run yet on the data; the reasons are few technical admendments as well as deciding which analysis is more suitable to the current data; in particular some found information suggests that the NPS Chat Corpus wouldn't be suitable enough for the type of analysis we want to do, so more reading is required
* I am adding to the project the analysis of several channels specifically those for helping with the curriculum; apart of Help channel that will include: HelpZiplines, HelpBonfires, and LetsPair
 * We are extending the activities regarding this project to also create a simple interface for reporting; @andela-bfowotade is joining the team; we are suggesting him *to lead the designing of the reporting interface*
* in order to fit the FCC programme we would like that interface to be mostly in JavaScript stack; a snack of the suggested content: http://codepen.io/ecccs/pen/rVgMKQ

**Some Results**
Do you know that...? *According to our available data, it appears that the number of messages in the Help channel between January and August this year didn't exceed by far the 75,000 messages...?*

As soon as I understand how to do it, I will also upload a pdf file with some few graphs and observations about the message activity in the above mentioned channels...

PLANNED ACTIVITIES:
* The classifier is still pending but requires a bit more of decising what and how to do that; I have some ideas; we will keep you informed
* @cdikibo is also willing to join the project; we are designing activities where she can also contribute"

We have agreed and deployed an installation using a VPS provider, taking an offer of 2 months of free access. The VPS will be the actual residence of the project and it will be connected to the repo.

Advantages are:
* More memory (required)
* More speed (likely important due to possible processing times)
* Bonus: faciliate access to Python Notebook
 
The project is being accessed from a C9 environment through SSH in order to facilitate pairing. @Lightwaves is the current owner of the architecture.

@dcsan: we can pull into the repo but we can push. It is no priority right now but you could make contact with @Lightwaves for eventually solving this situation?"

* Investigating a two stage Naive Bayesian classification over a sample of the /Help channel: first using the NPS Chat Corpus and then refine the classification with a partially annotated FCC chat corpus
* The goal is to verify how effectively we can detect the relevant questions/inquiries for help (Bonfires and Waypoints mostly)

* As mentioned before, we are pointing to quick analyses and early results; we decided that python and related libraries are more suitable for that, considering also our experience
* The code will reside in a repo that @dcsan created
* We are going to work on C9 and also Jupiter for Python Notebook; there will be a sync between github repo and C9
* This chat (/DataScience) is linked to the repo
* We will try to keep the data as confidential as possible (a recommended practice for this type of projects)

2) about help effectiveness: mmmm... I don't know about this point... not sure if the correct technique...
3) about food... not only of bread we are fed... (not sure if correct english...)

@Lightwaves: I don't want to overwhelm you with material right now... but at some point I will recommend some readings if you are interested... For the moment, NLTK main features to clean the data would be possibly the most useful part of it... We will be using additional shipped corpora that can be used for that end... Then there will be a point where I will stress the methodologies we need to go through:
--- Text Mining in the broad sense; this is likely the hard part because involves a LOT of theory about linguistic analysis
--- Machine Learning in the specific sense, as it will be used to complete part of the steps for the task above"

Then to figure out how effective a solution from response was we measure the response and the distance from the average  to see how ""effective"" the response is.

This probably isn't even close to being right. Just food for thought I guess."

So far I have been checking the literature to see if a simple naive bayesian classifier can offer a good option. If so, then translating that into a code is a piece of cake.

so then you can you filter out the stuff anyone else said and just take @annie, @bob comments

we can then mine those in the long term.

Hey... I have already predefined the project... it will be a rather easy to start with... then, if we find that it is worth working on it, we can start preparing a more complex one...

I am trying to keep it simple in the first place: the project could be VERY labourious without having a good material for training -/ validation -/ test datasets... things that I don't have (not an expert in Text Mining myself...). I spotted a corpus that can help to start identifying/classifying some of the texts but after that it seems to me that an specific corpus should be made to improve classification (a bit of an additional work...). For your info, this work (preparing a corpus for training purposes) could involve some ""manual work"". 

By keeping it simple, we can also incorporate some other people without experience that can be interested. I contacted @Lightwaves to give me a hand...

The plan is to use NLTK python library, possibly with default corpora, and use it ""as is"". We can eventually check the results, identify potential projects to focus on, and see if it is worth extending it... If everything goes fine, you can think of an eventual ML library (partially?) written in JS inserted in the FCC Repo for analytical purposes... but let's touch some milestones first..."

One of the questions that popped up to my mind was to explore the activity in the /Help channel: there are hours I don't see because I sleep meanwhile... I wonder: what are the peak times of activity in the /Help channel? What are the most requested help at each? How is the activity of the helpers at those times? Are there enough helpers to cover the demand at each peak? This could be an exploration of one month of data, just to show something..."

I guess that finding a full open source NLP engine could probe hard to find, I would say not necessarily due to the algorithms per se but because of the challenges for data cleaning and or the corpora that they use to standardise the text... my guess is that those corpora are an asset that no many people are willing to share... but who knows...

In the meantime, do you have any other thing in mind about data analysis that we can work easily? I would like to share this with going through completing the training in the meantime... Let me know? DM is ok too! Leaving now..."

Rather than trying to scrape them, I will ask if they can prepare an endpoint we can hit for a big dump. I don’t know how high priority this is, but considering that it would avoid a boat load of API calls, I think they’ll consider it.

1) Date of signup
2) True/false values for whether a given user has added LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook, Twitter or CodePen URLs
3) reported location
4) a unix timestamp of when they completed each challenge, if they've completed it yet.
5) Their longest consecutive streak of completing challenges each day and their current streak
6) Whether they've unsubscribed from our email
7) The timestamps of their non-challenge Brownie Points (submitting on Camper News then being upvoted, thank-you points for helping other campers in chat )
We plan to make this weekly-updated .csv file available at a public URL"
