We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

Trying to do some freecodecamp and udacity stuff. Been programming for a couple years, working a job right now so I don't have too much time to run through the freecodecamp challenges. I would like to meet some people though as that would be my main goal in doing codecamp is getting to know other community members. I'm really interested in things like Angular and node, although I find myself using things like jQuery and php more because that is what most my work projects require. Good luck to everyone on codecamp I hope to be able to enjoy working together with some of you in the future.
