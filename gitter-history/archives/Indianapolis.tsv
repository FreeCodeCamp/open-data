We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

If you are still looking for feedback: On my screen (13.3in), some of your buttons and your profile pic are cut off.

The color scheme works but maybe a little drab? Maybe add some more color or other stuff. There's lots of blank space. Functionally, Bootstrap has a way of making the nav bar stay on screen when you navigate away from the first frame. The way you have it now, once I click ""About"" or ""Portfolio"" I lose the chance to click any links. I think the class is called ""navbar-fixed"" or something similar. Also, on my desktop firefox, your photo on the ""about"" page is partly off the right side of the page. Cool if you want it that way, but I wasn't sure."

After checking out places Carmel, I actually looked something up on Google Maps as well. The travel time between Lafayette and parts of Carmel conducive to meetups is the same as going to the heart of Indy. So to save those who reside in the southern parts of Indy, like Soham, the extra travel time of getting up to Carmel, I'd actually suggest the opposite of my original plan. (I thougt otherwise about the travel time from Lafayette to Carmel.) I think we should stick to coffee shops and the like in the heart of Indy, especially if we can keep them near I65. I've still thrown a couple places from Carmel in the list, just in case, but I'd actually recommend against those at this point...
 
So, in Carmel, I've added the first two selections, but as good as they are, I'd recommend we stick with Indy spaces, to keep travel time roughly equal between those of us actually in Greater Indy.
I've added 3 places in Indy that have WiFi. I don't know what the service or food is like at them, though. 
Of course, Sahm's is also added back as well, JIC.
A couple of these places are only open for breakfast/lunch: Eggshell & Quills
 
- Hubbard & Cravens at Carmel City Center
- Eggshell Bistro (Carmel)
- Thirsty Scholar (Indy)
- Henry's on East (Indy)
- Starbucks (Indy)
- Quills Coffee (Indy)
- Sahm's Tavern (Indy)"

I know I am not, but at any meetup you absorb you  something (I always have) and you also start your networking.  Sometimes you can help someone else with something you know that can help them.

For those of you not in the local facebook, I am reposting this here: We are planning a meetup for this upcoming Wednesday from 4/4:30 until maybe 7:30 or so. The tentative location is MoJoe coffee shop downtown Indy (unless someone has a better location). Let us know so we can plan for how many people are coming.

The last two Bonfires I did, I felt like I understood what I needed to do and started working on right away them rather than hunting through the MDN pages for clues. My goal is a career change into web development. I've built and maintained my own website for the business I run, and I would like to expand on that.

It's comforting to know I'm not alone. I'm making progress, albeit much more slowly then earlier challenges. I checked out the Beta site, but for the section I'm working on it appeared there were fewer challenges, not more.

Some of them don't show any examples or explanations. I got a trial at code school to take the node classes. It's helping me understand. I've been looking at the basejumps though and I think they are going to take at least two weeks each so I think I will learn more as I am doing those. Have you checked out beta.freecodecamp.com? There are a lot of extra lessons I found helpful.

I'm having a tough time taking the MDN reference pages that are linked to and gleaning enough info from them to figure out what I need to do. I'm sticking with it, but find myself taking breaks to write little string manipulation scripts and practice some DOM manipulation, things I'm a little stronger on.

I’m starting with JavaScript because FCC seems to be such a fantastic resource, and the end-opportunity of working on a live project that actually has a purpose in the world is extremely intriguing. At some point I’d also like to mess with a couple other popular languages, like ruby, python, etc.

Sure, something at a Starbucks in Indy (maybe Northish, like Carmel area?) would be cool. I'm out of state for work right now, but I'll be around a fair amount in August. I'm not getting paid to do anything web or tech-related yet, but I've been dabbling for several years. I've built and maintain a few static websites and written an online educational game for musicians using JavaScript and jQuery.

I could drive down some evening if Steve wants to join me and we could meet others in Indy.

I think he is right on the mass but I will try and help.  I am across the river in Lafayette.  I guess you would say I am in tech.  I write code for a living about half the day and do project management the other half.  Right now I only use JavaScript a little on the front end and am very interested in the full stack.
559395c215522ed4b3e325c4	FreeCodeCamp/Indianapolis	2015-07-17T02:56:48.296Z	55a15b115e0d51bd787b0e38	stevemoss66	55a86ef0169d968632bee750	Me too. Well, I'll look forward to meeting you in Indy one of these days. I'm not sure we have critical mass on this chat room yet, but it seems like more people are joining all the time.
559395c215522ed4b3e325c4	FreeCodeCamp/Indianapolis	2015-07-16T00:21:53.396Z	55a1b9945e0d51bd787b15b4	tktechie	55a6f921584eabeb554a4da6	"Cool! That's the RegEx, right? I'm looking forward to that one! I've messed with RegEx searches when working on files in Sublime Text, so I really like the idea of getting more practice under my feet.
I have a tech background, in a sense. More from personal interest than anything up to now. I'd really like to find a job in programming though."

I'm toward the end of the first waypoint section, at #85. I had also previously done more than half of the codecademy js course before discovering FCC.  Are you coming from a tech background or fairly new to this stuff?
559395c215522ed4b3e325c4	FreeCodeCamp/Indianapolis	2015-07-15T17:40:41.197Z	55a1b9945e0d51bd787b15b4	tktechie	55a69b19a413aa9e5689fc5a	@stevemoss66 I'm moving through the early ones pretty fast, spending about an hour a night. Right now I'm working through the jQuery Waypoints, but the next section of Basic JavaScript will move pretty fast, since I did the Codecademy JavaScript course already a couple months ago. How goes it on your side?
559395c215522ed4b3e325c4	FreeCodeCamp/Indianapolis	2015-07-15T17:12:50.201Z	55a15b115e0d51bd787b0e38	stevemoss66	55a69492ea224d3609775291	Hi @tktechie, how are you doing with the coding challenges?
559395c215522ed4b3e325c4	FreeCodeCamp/Indianapolis	2015-07-15T16:11:02.959Z	55a1b9945e0d51bd787b15b4	tktechie	55a68616003280a056fa6c78	@fheld I'd be interested in an Indy meetup for FCC

I also just joined from Indy a couple days later"

559395c215522ed4b3e325c4	FreeCodeCamp/Indianapolis	2015-07-04T06:59:29.717Z	54c59047db8155e6700f1387	fheld	559784516505c69020c0bb51	It does the same for me.  Looks like the notice says EST and the calendar is PST  I am hoping EST is correct
559395c215522ed4b3e325c4	FreeCodeCamp/Indianapolis	2015-07-04T01:04:52.385Z	559730ac15522ed4b3e356b7	CW1118	55973134a6c8169b5632b80d	The email I received says the summit is at noon EST but on Google Calendar it says 3pm. Anyone know what time it is actually  starting?
