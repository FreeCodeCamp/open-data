However,  I would like my certification to be on the blockchain. I feel this should be the next step for freecodecamp. What can I do, and how can we make this possible for all campers. Currently I am learning about ethereum and I would like to contribute In any way I can to make this happen. Thank you

Yes, I've heard great things about Microsoft Virtual Academy. I would urge you to trust your instincts and follow whatever you're passionate about. Most campers use a variety of resources to learn development.

If you do work through MVA then please consider creating a review for it in the review section of our forum: https://forum.freecodecamp.com/c/reviews

I think other campers would be interested in hearing your take on it :)"

We are transitioning through a lot of stages and our concept is pivoting---Had an interesting conversation the other day comparing the fCC back-end curriculum  with that of C# and ASP.net.  The developer I spoke with was younger 20's maybe 30.  Anyway, he said that the languages and skills developed in fCC was the ""future' of development and that C# and the .net framework was utilized more in big business and legacy systems.  It was an interesting distinction and I found his points to be valuable.  Essentially, he said that a software engineering student would have a better chance of getting a job with a development shop than a Fortune 500 with the fCC back end skillset vs. C# and ASP.net.  Unfortunately, as my startup seeks new direction, I have to prepare for the job market and, in my previous industry (Geospatial Information Systems) I find a greater demand to integrate with the .net framework.  In light of this, I am currently working through Microsoft Virtual Academy on their C# for Absolute Beginners course.  Not sure if you have any input at this time.  

Thank you for making yourself so available.  You should get a medal for your work here with fCC.  I've met dozens of campers IRL through meetups and referred this curriculum to many more, even getting a non-profit registered and eyeballing another.

Hope you have a great evening."

I'd suggest a revision test, one with a guide, and then another without a guide after every chapter. 
Example, i just finished the HTML5/CSS chapter. it'd be sweet if i had a revision for them at the end, twice so that it would stick to memory and i could practice what i learned here with help and again, without help. Just  a thought!"

My two pennies about this whole ""design"" thing with developers.. As you move your career forward you need to be able to market yourself. If you're freelance. You need to market yourself to clients. And if you want to work for an agency or company you need to ""market"" yourself to the HR staff before you hit the hiring managers. If you look at your target demographic. HR staff tend not to be coders. So, you could have a super sweet solution for a problem with amazing code. Come on look how slick this code bit is: `const reverseStr = s => s.split('').reverse().join('');` but, do you think a non-coder would see that as ""elegant""? So, you need to drive a story. You need to showcase your developer skills and tell a story. In that story you need to showcase how YOU will drive business need and show how YOUR project/solution will save or earn the company more than they are paying you to offer whatever you offer.
In that, I will suggest some resources for trying your ""design"" chops. ... I will add here.. You don't need to be an AMAZING designer. You just have to show something that looks better than something I'd find on a Commodore64.
Here are my list of resources: https://hackdesign.org/ http://learndesignprinciples.com/
https://www.uxpin.com/studio/ebooks/ <-- Free e-books. You just need to give them you email address over and over and over
Color: https://color.adobe.com/  http://www.lolcolors.com/  https://coolors.co/app  http://flatuicolors.com/
https://pixelbuddha.net/ui-tiles/
Look, there are a lot of amazing resources for learning the ""design"" aspect of web process.
I even use a few graphics sites to find ""insparation"" for my web design sketches. ... Speaking of.. I highly recommend using 5x8"" index cards. The non-lined side for the sketch/wireframe and the lined size for the info/text about the ""design"". But, again.. If you're not solving a problem or offering a service. You're just creating for the sake of creating. Business needs problem solvers."

I'm surprised that kind of inconsistency is there. Then again, the JSON APIs and AJAX challenges have been needing an update for a while :worried: There will be some changes with those challenges so maybe after the changes are made, those inconsistencies will cease to exist.

- keep a change of clothes and accessories in cabin luggage. You never know when your luggage gets delayed.
- get an international adapter.
- check-in early online to have good window seat
- arrive much much earlier at the airport, like 3-4 hours before departure.
-  fill up immigration form knowing meanings of all the fields. If you need help, it's better to ask any airline personnel.
- in the immigration line, answer questions with yes and no; no matter how odd the questions are."

> As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document. For earlier versions, the .bind() method is used for attaching an event handler directly to elements. Handlers are attached to the currently selected elements in the jQuery object, so those elements must exist at the point the call to .bind() occurs. For more flexible event binding, see the discussion of event delegation in .on() or .delegate()."

We are moving the JavaScript section out of the front end section, which will give you a little more flexibility in doing this.

Hi guys I feel like I have no idea what bootstrap and jQuery is actually doing on the CSS and javascript side
does anyone have recommendations on how I can get a better sense of what these tools are doing? maybe I can find some source that teaches how to build the classes from scratch?"

- What are x and y axes
- What is translation
- What are coordinates"

- keep a change of clothes and accessories in cabin luggage. You never know when your luggage gets delayed.
- get an international adapter.
- check-in early online to have good window seat
- arrive much much earlier at the airport, like 3-4 hours before departure.
-  fill up immigration form knowing meanings of all the fields. If you need help, it's better to ask any airline personnel.
- in the immigration line, answer questions with yes and no; no matter how odd the questions are."

> As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document. For earlier versions, the .bind() method is used for attaching an event handler directly to elements. Handlers are attached to the currently selected elements in the jQuery object, so those elements must exist at the point the call to .bind() occurs. For more flexible event binding, see the discussion of event delegation in .on() or .delegate()."

Hi guys I feel like I have no idea what bootstrap and jQuery is actually doing on the CSS and javascript side
does anyone have recommendations on how I can get a better sense of what these tools are doing? maybe I can find some source that teaches how to build the classes from scratch?"

- What are coordinates"

But most React code (in the documentation and on the internet) use ES6. Also, functional programming code gets so much readable if ES6 arrow functions are used. MPJ also has a lengthy video on that.

I think we should teach ES6 last (in the JS section) unless we absolutely need to teach it earlier. So right before the advanced algorithms and advanced data structures.

I am asking because if we introduce ES6 syntax, we need to be consistent and use ES6 syntax from that point onwards in other challenges.

No point in teaching them a superior syntax, only to fall back to good old `var` and boilerplate `function(){}` code."

Imagine applying randomized CSS-filters every 15 minutes - then you'd always get a fresh experience looking at the certification. You'd never get bored, I promise :laughing:

> I think campers should be introduced to CORS before they dive into APIs

I agree, it's a really common issue - I talked to @MayankPratap (responsible for the API-challenges) about this exact thing yesterday but we thought it would be too complicated. However, when I think about it now again- we could probably add an example challenge where campers get to see seed code (what's provided initially in the challenge's editor) with two example API calls: One of them to an API with CORS enabled, the other to a CORS-disabled API (which will throw an error). Then we could explain the difference between the API calls - and what problem CORS solves for the web platform (it protects resources from freely being incorporated into other websites without permission?)

As for a getting started guide, read the following documents:
* https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/blob/master/README.md
* https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/blob/master/challenge-style-guide.md

Good luck & happy coding! :smile:

If the color-themed ones are still fair game, I can start with Learn about Complementary Colors through Adjust the Tone of a Color, and go from there. (Note, I'm new to this and may need help crafting the tests, I'll keep you posted)

This is exactly what I have been thinking for a few days. As an example, I wanted to create ES6 challenges that covers `let`, `const`, `var`; and then give them a small 10-20 lines of code to refactor from ES5 to ES6. So this 5-6 challenges would be grouped as **ES 6 variable declaration**
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2016-08-09T14:04:45.392Z	5586719a15522ed4b3e23add	evaristoc	57a9e2fdae838f6f5690d0bf	"Hi everyone,

I have been in contact with a camper who suggested that a good way to keep motivation is to group exercises in sections of logically related challenges.
e.g. while teaching JS, I intend to group them in section as in
* Knowing Primitives
* Functions
* Operators
* etc

It seems that for some users a long list of exercises might not feel homogeneous enough and it seems to give the impression of hard-to-reach.

Yes, we are separating them into groups but for some people that seems to be still a long list. The person mentioned experiences with other online platforms like CodeAcademy where the exercises are grouped in 9-13 related challenges. This could give a sense of small stages and small achievements that could be more desirable than one long step.

The argument, again, is in favour of improving the motivation. Just an observation to take in consideration?"

It seems there's quite a bit of research related to the positive benefits of static typing. If you haven't read it, here's a good article on when you should consider using TypeScript: https://medium.com/free-code-camp/when-should-i-use-typescript-311cb5fe801b#.i3q00b88a

I think we should worry about that in a later iteration of the curriculum, though. If we have time after we've integrated the current challenges and tested them, we could consider adding it real quick before the Sept. 2 launch."

Well, we are still in the phrases of expanding our curriculum. We would have an ES6 challenge section soon. I know that TypeScript is a superset of ES6; but we have never felt the need to use TypeScript in our codebases.

Static typing is cool, but it's also a two-edged sword.

That being said - would you like to build a TypeScript section?
We would ideally want to have the section deal with
- What is TypeScript
- What benefits it has over regular ES6 code - does it make the code smaller and more readable
- How to use it
- How to setup a task to compile TypeScript to ES5, so that browsers can run it

 Please ping here or ping me if you are interested. @QuincyLarson @abhisekp @atjonathan @koustuvsinha @erictleung FYI."

I'm working on the security challenges for example, without really knowing much before I started on this project but up until now, I've learned so much

In attendance: @Greenheart @alayek @koustuvsinha @AkiraLaine and @utsab.

Here's what we discussed:

Timeline:

1) get as much information (text, tests, seed code, resources) into the GitHub issues as possible
--- by August 23 morning in the US ---
2) Quincy will transfer that information into the seed JSON files (manually or using the COM 1000)
3) make sure all the challenges are in a reasonable order and the map looks like it should
4) deploy to beta. multiple people work through all the challenges to see whether there are any major issues. (Quincy will rework the wording of challenges)
--- September 2 (a Friday) --- 
5) announcing the changes and deploying the change

Notes:
- We reviewed all issues and created two new tags:
  - [ultra high priority](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22ultra+high+priority%22) for topics that we absolutely must ship on September 2
  - [running behind on schedule](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Running+behind+on+schedule%22) for topics that are at serious risk of not being ready by September 2
- @berkeleytrue is creating the list of challenges for the React challenges this weekend (the biggest and most critical bottle neck at this point) and will shortly after create them for the Redux and React+Redux topics
- @em-ent has ported all but one of the example back end projects to HyperDev. He and @greenheart are building the Node School replacement challenges using HyperDev. They will use the same approach with the infosec challenges.
- We plan to introduce @atjonathan's new certificate functionality along with new challenges.
- We still have several topics where we need topic owners, if anyone is interested in tackling them."

The **instructions** could be clarified - ""increase the value of a global variable by one"" sounds like the goal is to mutate the parameter. Maybe ""Complete the `incrementer`function so it accepts a number as it's parameter and returns the number incremented by one"" could work? :blush:"

It's not a complete challenge, should I add it anyway - just some seed code (**which could be used for challenge 1 and 2**)

Also, I've got some feedback for [Show Me What You Got](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/16#issuecomment-234735339). Do you want the feedback as GH-comments or messages here?"

However, several parts of the description are really good and could fit in an updated challenge.

It's a good idea to use the first challenge to show the problem and then the second to explain why it's a problem plus show how to fix it. The challenge @BKinahan and I came up with two days ago could easily be split into two parts like this."

The solution is to use a pure function that can work with a given input (array with data) and instructions for how to sort it that then returns the result - without modifying the array it got passed as an argument.

It is somewhat counterintuitive to do so, but I agree, it wouldn't be practical to introduce a second language just for the data structures section

Another it the use of reduce with commutative operations it's amazing when you find problems with this  type of solution.

reduce and greatest common multiple was one
Only issue is the performance of these solutions aren't always that great.

The risk with just telling them how to write secure code is that they don't get the right context to see what an attacker sees but just know a few loose details.

I'm using the project-approach - several challenges focusing on different parts of one example. It's a solid way of teaching things at the same time as the learner can feel good progress.

I'm on a slow connection so I can't check the course atm but it seems to be similar to how I'm structuring it.

My questions now are:
1. Can I use the first challenge of the Security-section to give a short introduction without any coding?
2. Please read my previous message again :blush:"

The most significant part is the ""2 minute rule"" - all non-project, non-checkpoint, non-algorithm challenges should be completable within 2 minutes. I have always felt this should be the case, and I think this now with our curriculum expansion efforts is the right time to codify it."

But it may be outside of the bounds of the current framework for curriculum that you're using (I don't know much of anything about the current FCC setup). Some of the proposed challenge ideas for #23 may also be outside the bounds of what is possible to test a camper on at this point, but I don't know.

Testing is the most obvious one (and I think it deserves its own section).  I've found this list to be pretty comprehensive: http://www.softwareqatest.com/qatfaq1.html#FAQ1_10

There are a lot of terms we could potentially introduce, if we could figure out a way to represent these types of tests interactively - perhaps with a piece of broken code that campers would go on to fix."

I'll have you take a look at that first before I do anything with #24 since some may be crossover between the two.

Our current thinking is that the QA challenges would be as applied as possible (none of Free Code Camp's curriculum focuses on pure theory - it's all applied). So to the extent we can teach these concepts interactively, we can cover them. Otherwise, we would include them in our video challenges or on our wiki.

Do you foresee these being taught at different points in the curriculum? In my mind, the Automated Testing Challenges seem more concrete/foundational as opposed to the QA challenges which seem like they would be a little more theory. I know it is refered to as ""Applied"" though, so maybe I'm not fully comprehending your idea behind #24. Any thoughts?"

We aim to finish all of these several hundred challenges and have them live on Free Code Camp by September 1.

There's no need to wait for the improved FCC infrastructure. @berkeleytrue is making rapid progress in building the multi-file editor functionality. For now, you can assume that if your code works on CodePen, it will work on FCC. Focus on the design of the challenges - we can improve the code and tests during our lengthy QA cycle in August.


Here's a quick overview of recent progress we've made:

@ChaituVR has already designed Responsive Web Design Project: Survey Form (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/12) and he's working on a couple similar projects.

@cdikibo has already started creating a list of topics that we'll cover in our D3 challenges (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/20)

@Daynil @ChaituVR and @atjonathan are steadily working on the new Node/Express challenges that will replace our use of a couple NodeSchool modules (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/26)

@greenheart is making steady progress with our Applied Information Security challenges (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/25)

@erictleung has made considerable progress on our new regular expression challenges. This will now be a separate section (and not just a few challenges lumped into the JavaScript section). (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/22)

@koustuvsinha is leading the effort to cover advanced data structures, which are frequently the subject of whiteboard coding interviews (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/17)

@Bouncey has made considerable progress building the CatPhotoApp that will be used as part of the new HTML5 and CSS challenges (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/6)

@AkiraLaine has already created several SASS challenges (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/1)

Also, I'd like to introduce @gsfebby. You may have tried his ""simply"" Chrome Extension, which he built in less than 24 hours for my ""one does not simply learn to code"" article (https://medium.freecodecamp.com/one-does-not-simply-learn-to-code-f25bacdc5b62 article.)"

What happens is, whenever I finish a challenge and move onto the next one, I often can't click and have the text editor go where I want it to go. I have to click on an area where it will allow me to go then hit enter, and from there I can move the cursor where I want. I will file an issue. I wasn't sure where to do that. Thanks!

i was thinking we make a comic e.g.
1. **Display some vegetables with names in an array**
2. **Map those names splitting them apart e.g.**
 https://gist.github.com/abhisekp/79d7371be042133998988e9c9759ea1a#file-splitin2-md
3. **Then reducing them into 1 big name taking the 1st half**

A very playful and fun way to learn.

but first we need to show the beauty of functional style over impertative without any traps e.g.

### Functional over Imperative

```js
var arr = [1, 2, 3]
```

----

```js
for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i) {
  var currEl = arr[i]

```

**vs**

```js
// not pure but functional programming
arr.forEach(console.log.bind(console))

Someone made a mess using for loops inside for loops inside for loops, writing the answer to this question. 

So i was thinking what if we run a walkthrough step by step non-isolated (*solution need not pass over*) challenge where the user first tries to solve this without any functional awesomeness. 
Then the user tries to solve it using JS builtins.
And later they create helper functions like `partial` and `curry` and `flow` or `compose` to write this kinda soln. 

```js
const arr = [
  ""0002-0002-0003-0004"",
  ""5874-1734-1294-0004"",
  ""4234-9999-1234-1234"",
  ""4346-1234-1004-5884"",
  ""0002-0002-0004-0003""
]

/*
1. split the array elements at `-` to 2D array
   [[""0002"",""0002"",""0003"",""0004"", ..., ...]
2. Parse each inner array elements to numbers
   [[2, 2, 3, 4], ..., ...]
3. Sum each array
   [11, 8906, 16701, 12468, 11]
*/

const fp = require('lodash/fp')

const sums = fp.map(fp.flow(
  fp.split('-'),
  fp.map(fp.toNumber),
  fp.sum
))

console.log(sums(arr))
//=> [ 11, 8906, 16701, 12468, 11 ]
```"

Our goal is to introduce the camper to some functional ideas; array processing functions etc. Ideally, we would want them to be able to use some basic ideas in their day to day coding - like don't mutate state all over the place, or write pure functions that are easily testable - to the extent they can.

refactoring a real world project would be a real take away point but that also must be walked through as not everyone would be comfortable refactoring code as opposed to **building a new functional Calculator** afresh or a basic project using FP.

Refactoring is painful. Building new one is easy.

Remember, we need real life data sets to use map-filter on them. Like the LearnRx example.

Also, there would be ample practice with those. As in it should not be three challenges - map, filter, and reduce."

These are 2 - 3 minute long stand alone videos that each cover a single concept. Here are some examples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmfoj2Th9fvxhHIeqFO7wOy&v=q7tlgZg4Q1o

54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2016-07-07T22:51:19.842Z	571d9fac659847a7aff45a7e	mafelix	577edce7c9b49c1d6fd078b9	@QuincyLarson you can do it in a code editor. but I don't think it'll solely be done in the code editor. A simple lecture video around 20-30mins should be made that explains basic routing what http requests , http verbs are and what are headers.

A rough, quick example I just thought of is to search for multiple instances of a word in a string, but it may have case differences. I can give a very crude iterative solution and then show a regex solution. I think it'll be overwhelming to explain the entire regex solution at the beginning so I guess we could just hint you'll learn what this regex means later."

I've been using a number of external resources and my favorite is RegExr. It keeps getting better. It makes use of rollovers to describe each component of the regex and you can really drill down into how they are constructed. It is open source, so while it currently exists as a pure sandbox (i.e. it's not a graded progression of 'challenges'), maybe it might be advantageous to campers if it could be re-configured as a plugin to your challenges?

Are you suggesting me to rather list the titles of possible exercises and a task per point? I can try for some of the points I suggested, not for all I am afraid.

However I will be always using external references for that. Exercises in the books are nicely commented, IMO those are good sources so I don't see why not to read external documents?

> would you be interested in breaking this book down into concepts you think can be taught in an interactive code editor?

What I think it could work is the following:
1. A short exercise with SVG. SVG is different from CSS shapes in many ways, so a short introduction would be nice. Ch 3 of the book. Pick a couple of exercises that highlight some differences and similarities.
2. A first encounter with d3.js: generating page elements. Ch 5 of the book of the same title. Some exercises in that section are relevant.
3. First aspect to understand: d3.js is mostly about DATA. The first part of the ""Binding Data"" in the Ch 5 would be useful.
4. The SELECTION aspect of d3.js. Same Ch 5, same part (""Binding Data""), subtitle ""Please Make your Selection""
5. Using data to draw things. Ch 6 up to ""The Power of data()"".
6. Difference between selections and appends. I don't know what to recommend here, but relevant!
7. Understanding Enter-Update-Exit cycle. Here I would suggest another resource instead: https://medium.com/@c_behrens/enter-update-exit-6cafc6014c36#.or8lsjkpb. I would recommend to break the exercises according to what C. Behrens recommends.
8. (Back to the book) I would suggest to finish the Ch 6: Adding SVG, Making a Barchart and Making a Scatterplot

Other chapters (7 and 8) are about adding components and styling the just-created charts, but I think that those 8 points given above would cover the basis. I think they could be split in 3-5 exercises (average) per point, but I would emphasis on point 6 and more specially point 7, which is one of the most difficult things to understand, IMO.

Working with transitions and layouts (Ch 9 and beyond) is important but better if you master the Enter-Update-Exit cycle and understand selections and appends FIRST. Also, the selection can add hard-to-debug errors (silent ones) that would affect the whole cycle. What I haven't seen in practice but not in tutorials is the impact of wrongly coding selections and appends. Sometimes the chaining nature of JS could play you a trick. I would recommend to find and include 1 to 3 exercises working with selections that involve the SVG `group` element in ways that are prone to error and try to debug. The `group` element is an important one that could be tricky to handle.

Also, the book was very helpful in suggesting ideas of how to debug d3.js but there is no specific chapter.

Hope this helps?"

I jokingly said once you get 1000, you get a job. But jokes aside, what if there was like little milestones here for when you get a certain amount of points or complete some parts of the curriculum. Like maybe once you get your front end certificate you get a fcc shirt. Maybe if you get like 300 points you get a hat or some doo dad. Little prizes along the way. I don't know how fcc would pay for it, but it would be pretty neat if done correctly.

@evaristoc the goal is to prepare campers for a contemporary developer job. The target demographic is people who want to get a developer job. All the other people we serve (students, retirees) are just icing on the cake, but the curriculum is not designed for them. 

This expansion of the curriculum will not make completion of all of the certifications easier - it will this process *more informative and less frustrating*.

It doesn't hurt to touch on advanced data structures, since interviewers frequently bring them up."

So perhaps my views about suggesting that getting enough knowledge/experience to help an NGO would give you enough curriculum to get a position or start your own project could be plenty of naïveness. In that case, the advanced curriculum is totally justified.

I had a look at the new curriculum. My views?

I have seen an outstanding evolution of the curriculum since FCC started in 2014 (I joined 2015) and witnessed what it could be interpreted as a ""professionalization"" of the standards that FCC should follow to prepare the curricula (thanks @SaintPeter again!). This last iteration is getting **better**!

However I wonder at which point FCC should keep a boundary between ""this is far too easy"" and ""this is far too difficult"". Make it too easy, and people won't get to the end and they won't get any learnings. Make it too difficult and people won't get to the end and they won't get any learnings.
* https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/inverted-u.htm
* http://www.slideshare.net/PowerPoint-Templates/goals-powerpoint-presentation-templates

I am personally in favour to make a curriculum of excellence: FCC should be known as such, but before pursuing FCC ideal I was to ask: *what is the goal?*
* *Helping NGO's?* How much a person would need to get to that stage with the less friction possible and still make a good contribution?
* *Being a guarantee of job finding?* Well... it is likely that you might be able to make a project for an NGO with a basic knowledge, but depending on the job position and the company, you might be asked to have a certain level of ""knowledge"", mostly if you are competing with other candidates who has been at Uni. There was a very interesting article some time ago about that published in FCC News (RIP...).

It is important to recognise who is FCC target? Someone with basic knowledge of programming, or a CS (under) graduate student?

That said, I wonder for which of those two goals knowing **advanced** data structures (eg. dequeues, trees) or algorithms (eg. dynamic programming) could be beneficial? (*Disclaimer*: I know those structures and algorithms listed).

I don't disagree with the introduction of advanced elements in the curriculum. I am just asking for finding a balance that allows FCC to reach its goal. If the goal is to:
> Train students with interest and some previous training in programming to get jobs in JS

I will agree to leave those advanced elements of the curriculum as *compulsory*.

If the FCC goal is:
> Let students with no knowledge of programming to learn enough to help NGO's

I think the added content is rather too advanced. I won't ask to get rid of new add-ons, but in that case, I would suggest to consider that as optional.

- So, a contributors X writes lesson, it passes existing checks and is merged. Then Y and Z notice its inconsistencies and use the *detailed style guide* to rewrite. If and when they had time/inclination.

But a style guide, especially in the way i described -- one section (imagine a well designed, pretty one page website that's no more than 800 words) that simply encourages ways of thinking for contributors. And completely separate section -- a technical style guide that's there to ensure consistency. This one is *only* used by those who want to, and not necessarily by the people who write the lessons! People like me, learners from diff backgrounds -- like publishing, writing, etc, they'll be enough can contribute by just **editing** the already created content and apply the existing style guide to maintain consistency. Nothing needs to be thrown back at the lesson creator, yes, they'll have to answer questions to provide clarity once in a while, but that's anyway something they'll likely need to do.

It divides the work. It, in fact, opens the system to *more* contributions: those of people who could not write lessons, but can help change the language of them to be more accessible."

I am working on a list of those that we would need to cover now. Almost all of them can be created in JavaScript - we wouldn't introduce a second language into the core curriculum (such as C) just to teach these.

Right now, there are large gaps in what we teach. This was the plan all along. We set out to create a more broad curriculum, and I think we've done a decent job of this. Now we need to go back in and fill in the gaps we've left behind in the process. 

Once we overhaul our curriculum, it should be dramatically easier and less frustrating for people who are still early on in it, and for future campers."

You're abolsutely right that is is a massive technical debt that you likely cannot invest in correcting full-item at the cost of expanding the course itself. 
However, when you say that people won't care about the old stuff if the new stuff keeps getting postponed, you're dismissing learners like *me*, who are newer and still in the 'old stuff'. 

Enabling new learners to reach the higher levels, i feel, must be just as important as providing new materials for more advanced learners. No?

However, like I mentioned in the Core Team Gitter (sorry about that, didn't notice the alert that said viewing only), I sincerely believe that there's a serious problem with some of the lessons precisely because there hasn't been a guideline to ensure consistency and clarity. This creates massive obstacles for people trying to learn to code who come from *very very* varied backgrounds and do not necessarily have the same style/language as CS folk or other tech folk. In some cases, such as the *Objective Oriented Programming* section, the massive change in structure from the previous section (*Basic Javascript*) is so unsettling that, I imagine, it scares some people away. I think a style guide is quite essential, truly. 

That said, I do understand that getting more contributions is key to ensuring the success and growth of FCC. One idea I have to mitigate the problem a strict style guide creates is a slightly different format for the style guide. One that's divided into two parts: 

- 1. A simplified, friendly stylistic primer that encourages contributors to question their own assumptions, and have a basic sense of how lessons should be structured and why they should more clearly defined and the need to elaborate on technical terms and concepts.
- 2. A detailed and technical manual that closely examines grammar, style, formatting, and structural conventions to create consistence at a more granular level. This can be used by contributors who have the time, patience, etc... and, more importantly, by *editors* or *moderators* who can help ensure clarity and resolve ambiguities even they could not have written out the lesson itself.  

I'm sure there are many other ideas for ways to find solution that resolves both the problems of QA/consistency i.e. the learner's entry barrier and the problems of complicating the contribution process i.e. the contributor's entry barrier."

I definitely like the way Google's material style guide is *formatted/outlined*. While obviously actual grammar and syntax is a necessary part of the style guide. I feel that the issues @carradee raised in #9291 are more essential.

That is -- helping contributors understand that they are writing for the *Lowest Common Denominator* and have to explain or link to definitions of every piece of jargon/technical term they introduce, that they structure their lessons with an introduction to the concept, and example of how it plays out, an optional note on any exceptions or additional information and a concisely worded, unambiguous set of instructions for passing the waypoint. 

The style guide, is less style in my mind and more structure. I imagine a guide that helps contributors  question each of their assumptions about the prior knowledge of the learner as well as unstated assumptions within instructions. "

Thanks for bringing up the style guide issue. So there was some discussion using a style guide for the new upcoming content. I've started creating the regex section and how I'm writing the challenges stylistically is using http://www.hemingwayapp.com/. It tells me generally the grade level of reading and some generalities of it being difficult to read or not. 

We could look through some style guides and borrow some of their rules that apply to FCC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_style_guides. Wikipedia has its own style guide we could reference as they cater to a very wide audience https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3aManual_of_Style"

### Goal 
Our main goal is to create a RegEx curriculum, that:
- covers most aspects of RegEx
- makes everyone comfortable using RegEx, as easily as they use for-loop or `map()`, `filter()`.
- makes everyone comfortable understanding other people's RegEx, or at least be able to use a service like regex101 to parse and understand RegEx.

We might need to come up with a linked story that shows some applications of RegEx. In real world, we use RegEx for log parsing, altering config files when we do auto environment setup, antiviruses, compilers, transpilers etc.

We could create some basic simple version of that. I was thinking we create a serial story like we did for Bootstrap curriculum - fix the page with cat photo. We could do something like simple Markdown parsing.

### Workflow:
 Please make a PR to the branch in @erictleung's fork. If he accepts the changes, the PR would automatically be updated.

### Challenges:
- One RegEx problem can be solved in many different ways. We need to be able to write test cases that focuses on checking if the solution is following what we want the campers to learn at that exercise.

Let me know your thoughts on this.

@koustuvsinha @arun1595 @QuincyLarson @SaintPeter FYI."

I took it at face value and that's just how I code now. But I Googled and came up with what you did: personal preference. But camelcase is used by W3C. :)

Can you cite the reference that says using camel case is a best practice for class names? I couldn't find any with a quick search.

The closest thing I could find was [a poll on using camel case vs hyphen vs underscore](https://css-tricks.com/new-poll-hyphens-or-dashes/). My conclusion from that poll is it doesn't really matter as long as it is legible and it is more of a stylistic thing. My own preference generally is hyphens for HTML/CSS and camel case for functions/variables in programming languages :smiley: 

Also, while I'm not claiming that [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) follows best practices, seeing as it is one of the most popular frameworks on the web, they use hyphens in their class names (e.g. `col-md-6`). So if they were not following best practices, someone would have mentioned it and changed something.

What other missing best practices is FCC not adhering to? FCC generally tries to teach best practices so if there is anything missing, I think it would be worth correcting and we will consider any feedback seriously."

For example, using camel case instead of  hyphens when making classes and the like?

The FreeCodeCamp curriculum is designed for beginner coders and those concepts are a bit advanced. However, if others feel it would be worthwhile to have those taught, you're more than welcome to [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/new) requesting for those kind of challenges.

Doing this it outputs a lot to the console and its hard to read my output.  But on jsfiddle it just does it once for my code.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong on the FCC console.

But I agree, that particular section needs some love. The problem with those challenges in terms of copy-and-paste is that (to my knowledge) we can't perfectly test async events. The closest thing we can do is regex for common answers but people can come up with creative ways to solve the problem. If you have knowledge of JSON APIs and AJAX, you're more than welcome to contribute and add to the content.

Been busy with other things lately. In response to your suggestion, I think that would be a good addition in that I don't think it introduces too much new information on how to use these comparison operators that it confuses people. You'll welcome to open an issue on this :smiley: 

 @Ashtheyogi we appreciate any feedback about the curriculum. I think that would be most ideal if incrementally, there is reuse of previously learned concepts. At least for the JavaScript section, there are challenges spread throughout that are a little more challenging than just learning, say, what the `===` operator does, like [Golf Code](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/golf-code), [Counting Cards](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/counting-cards), and [Record Collection](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/record-collection). What other kind of review did you have in mind?

@geligelu the Sass, D3, and React are projected to be released over the summer. The hikes on the other hand are dependent on community contributions so those have a less defined release roadmap.

@geligelu although internationally used, FreeCodeCamp was founded in the US so I don't think there should be a surprise on using US standards in challenges like this one dealing with money. What names would you suggest that is less esoteric?

@benschac Hi! I'll have to go ask about ES6 development. I don't think we plan on adding ES6 anytime soon but I can't remember the reason why. I'll have to get back to you on a better reason or to correct my statement.

 @thorstenschaefer your feedback is much appreciated and I think you bring up good points. If you have suggestions on additional D3 projects or enhancements, you're welcome to create a GitHub issue about it."

I finished all challenges except the react ones. My general impression is that the frontend part was very good, while the other parts are significantly weaker. one issue is obviously the content which is not available for the dataviz or seems to be just a collection of other resources (backend part) - the good thing about the frontend part was that it was a consistent development, where in each step a new feature was introduced. i understand that the other parts are currently work in progress, so let's focus on the challenges using the data visualization part as an example.
i have 2 issues with it.
1. they don't really show the power of d3. every single challenge produces a static chart - the only dynamic part is a tooltip (which is required in basically all challenges). after using the library for a few days now, the actual cool thing about d3 is its handling of enter/update/exit phases - something that's not really touched as everything can be done in the enter phase. also, other features like animation/transitions aren't touched.
2. 3 of the 5 challenges are basically the same thing. while a force-directed graph and the world map differ and thus are interesting, the other 3 challenges use the exact same features - the only difference is that one time we create a circle, the other time a rectangle. this makes the whole thing pretty boring to be honest. 
i played around a little bit with d3, just to see what's possible with it and i'm really impressed. here's my current version: https://thorstenschaefer.github.io/d3-playground/
for instance, in the GDP example, i wanted to make it a bit dynamic by enabling users to select the years for which data should be displayed. in the heatmap example, i changed it by adding a second graph over the heat map which shows the yearly average temperature. both features are easily doable but let the students explore different aspects, which tackles both issues stated above. to conclude, i think little changes can make the challenges way more interesting and lead to a better learning experience. and now i'm off trying to reimplement the meteorite visualization completely dynamic based on Rxjs streams so people can see the world burning in motion :D"

I first want to say that I love the program and me and my partner are enjoying becoming a part of the community. One thing I have found challenging though is the straightforward method that goes into doing each project. We jump from one puzzle to the next without any chance for reviewing what we learned previously. For me, it makes it harder to remember how to apply older concepts that I learned. I think It would help us all if there was a little repetition when moving forward. We could make the curriculum so that older concepts and puzzles connect with and build upon newer concepts in puzzles. I think that would help solidify the material in our heads and make us even greater software engineers! What do y'all think?

""Since === (or any of the [comparison operators](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp)) returns true or false, we can simply return the result of the comparison:""

The reason I mention this is the example and explanation uses operators of equal value and equal type.  This at least lets people know it works for all ... and this case they'll need to use one of those comparison operators anyway. Also, in this case the W3 schools explanation is more concise than MDN and additionally includes the returned  value."

> 
You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.

>
A common anti-pattern is to use an if/else statement to do a comparison and then return true/false:

```
function isEqual(a,b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
>
Since === returns true or false, we can simply return the result of the comparison:

```
function isEqual(a,b) {
  return a === b;
}

Details are easy to look up via Google whenever you need to know them but what really matters when you work through these small JavaScript challenges is to think about the concepts, try to understand how you could use them as tools for solving different problems. The loops for example are a great tool for doing *repetitive tasks*

I'm afraid I overuse the chat rooms. Usually they leave me feeling more confused. I just don't know what it takes to cement the knowledge learned in these things. There was a period of about 3 months when I was coding hours each day. I just started going through basic JavaScript again today for the 4th time because I have no idea which parts I'm not getting, if not all of them. I go to FCC meetups, but if I'm on my own, or not face to face with someone, the info escapes me in the worst possible way. I've tried finding sites to run through for loop practice, but I've found nothing. I'm dying over here.

1) Add the number to the end of the array. *Got it, use .push(item); ...*
2) then remove the first element of array.  *Ok, that's .shift();*
3)The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed. *What, what? How do I do that?*"

The problem here isn't so much with the exercise as the instructions -- although the concept of  ‘use strict’ hasn’t been addressed. This is, if I recall correctly, the start of metasyntactic variables and the confusion they cause. 
```
	function myTest() {
  	  var loc = ""foo"";
  	  console.log(loc);	
	}
	myTest(); // ""foo""
	console.log(loc); // ""undefined""
```
I personally find metasyntactic variables to be really confusing. 'Foo' tells you nothing and in no way aids in understanding. Throw in a second one, usually bar and then you have what looks likes is someone who was too lazy to come up with a good example but had enough desire to look clever (foo - bar ... get it? FUBAR!??! Aren't I clever? HAHAAH!!)   Contrast  that example with this one (from Return a Value from a Function with Return)
```
	function plusThree(num) {
 	  return num + 3;
	}
	var answer = plusThree(5); // 8
```

The rest you can just auto-do but you don't really get the purpose of fun2.  If you complete it and then go back and look at the fun2 code and think you'll see what happens if you take out the initialized value of 10 for the myGlobal just to see if you're right and perhaps it will come back as undefined, it stills says you're good to go. And you've learned nothing.

I think making an issue for each lesson you'd like to critique would be easier to handle for people wanting to fix each challenge. Plus, if others find a particular challenge to be okay, then we can close that one issue and focus on the others, rather than having a really large issue and not knowing which parts we agree on keeping without reading the entire discussion. But whatever you feel is easiest people should be fine with.

The reusable function challenge has multiple issues with it FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp#8551, FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp#8526,  and FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp#8302.

 @Y-Taras when you say ""quiz,"" do you mean something like a multiple choice quiz page to test knowledge? If so, I'm assuming there is no quiz because we want you to learn by doing rather than by a quiz. Knowing *what* a `for` loop is and does is different than *knowing how* to use a `for` loop.

 @vaspv  I agree. Most of the front end has been well vetted because of the number of individuals who go through it and the feedback we get. The more time that passes, the more people will get through the back end challenges as well. If you have any specific suggestions on how to change the current back end challenges you're doing through, you can always open up a Github issue with the challenge name and what you can suggest to improve the challenge."

However, we do have a [Wiki page on callbacks](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Javascript-Callback-Functions) that might be a first step to understanding them.

This is the second time I've heard that suggestion. Although I agree it makes more sense to make it up-shift and down-shift, I think the challenge is to make it slightly different from the example so you can code it yourself, rather than a straight copy-paste and do a simple change of variables. However, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/new) on our GitHub page and tag me on there for others to discuss it as well.

I'm also new new to this room and joined after being pointed to it. I'm here not because I'm an expert but mostly because I'm so new and find the jumps in the JS section to lead to a lot of frustration. That said, I love FCC and want to help make it better for those who come after rather than just complain.

54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2016-05-02T21:40:17.862Z	55864aa415522ed4b3e2391a	CrashyBang	5727c941df1a01ff18fbd449	Awesome, the application will also have an API so if you wanted to keep the flow of your site you could send un-compiled code over and get compiled code back and you would be responsible for everything else, if that suits let me know.
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2016-05-02T21:39:04.823Z	5665ed1116b6c7089cbdce40	sludge256	5727c8f8944fc7ba04cc6793	I'll forward your proposal.

A lot of times the tools they say to download or the syntax they say to use change and then beginners are lost when things don't compile lol

Then when you DO read the textbook it will make a lot more sense WHY our even HOW you might use an aspect of the programming language.

I've been under the truly misinformed notion that reading a textbook on the subject will enable me to acquire the skills needed. What's unfortunate is just not being able to find others who are at the same beginner level as myself and are willing to work together.

You can read books until you're blue in the face and they just won't help as much as the experience of actuall playing the game or dancing.

If you look in the wikimedia sandbox  and play around with it there it might help make sense.

We are provided with a URL to get a random article, but...can we just plug that into a Jquery request like we did for Random Quote Machine? The Wikimedia API seems to outline a much more complicated procedure for querying the API. Reading the documentation, there's a lot of stuff in there that hasn't been covered by FCC, and I'm not sure where to look for clarification on unfamiliar terms.  I'm just not sure if I'm over-complicating this challenge.

Note that the times listed are, at best, as wild ass guess.  We have increased them some, but they're really just a sort of line in the sand to help people understand.

for example, I have worked with html and css, and I flew through the bonfires which took about the time suggested. However... going through Basic JavaScript has taken waaay longer than 10 hours! Now I'm almost done with it, and have taken notes, but I have been putting in 6-16 hour days. I have decided to start over from the beginning of the Basic JavaScript to make sure I'm mastering it, because there's no point in just getting points if you don't fully understand it. You need to be able to have it in the back of your mind if you're going to be using this in a workplace. I have done PHP which is similar in concept, but still having issues... Someone needs to rethink the time aspect, as far as someone learning and being able to recall the information on demand. You can't just do something once and expect to recall it on demand... it takes repetition!"

I have been in software for almost  15 years now but  early in my career got pulled into management role. Now after taking a couple of years break from the field totally i am looking to get back into it. Have done some c++ and java in the past but java has become this huge beast that coming back to it is somewhat un-enticing. Is javascript the best route? I do love building cool webinfrastructure so no problem on the inspiration side; need something to master that will open some doors first.

The Free Code Camp code runner has a built in Infinite Loop Protect feature, leveraged from [JSBin's Loop Protect](https://github.com/jsbin/loop-protect).  The loop protect injects some code into user created loops to allow a safe exit if more than ~500ms has passed without exiting the loop.  Loop protect will catch many, but not all infinite loop issues.
If you see this message:  
`Error: Potential infinite loop at line X`  
It means you have been protected from an infinite loop.  
**Note:** Loop Protect cannot detect infinite recursion.

### Disable Loop Protect
In some cases - a slow computer or a long loop - you may get an incorrect loop protect.  In order to disable loop protect, add the following comment over the line the loop protection message lists:  
`//noprotect`  

**Warning:** Disabling loop protect means you may potentially allow your code to go into an infinite loop, causing your browser to be unresponsive.

### Recovering Unresponsive Code
If you have erred and incorrectly disabled loop protection and now have an unresponsive solution, you can [Disable Code Auto-Run](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/wiki/Disable-Code-Auto-Run).

The CodePen JS itself also pulls something in over HTTP, but not sure if that will trigger the same issue.  Seems like a straightforward fix, I just can't suss out how/if y'all accept contributions against curriculum.

It does put me at ease a bit knowing that I'm not necessarily an anomaly when it comes to the rate of progression and understanding or both. 

And you're definitely right. The chat rooms are fantastic, and I've never been ridiculed or admonished for seeking help. I suppose my main concern is that I've resorted to looking up the solutions ( maybe too soon, I don't know). Though, when it comes to doing that, I will say that I don't study their code as much as glance at it for maybe three seconds, take note of the elements they're using (i.e. ""any variables, for loops, etc.?"") and then try to construct something knowing what features were used. In your opinion, is that a cop-out? Also, after a couple of weeks, I'll go back to some of the more challenging chapters and try them again once I've forgotten the code that I previously used.  

Like I said earlier, I REALLY like FCC and the end goal, and I'm not ragging on the program at all. Just trying to figure out how to proceed.  I think @thaisrodrigues is probably right. Even at this point, I'm not really sure what a variable does exactly. Or a function. Maybe the variable is that I can't function, haha."

http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard
http://josephg.com/blog/what-i-tell-all-new-programmers/

The key, I think, when you're totally lost, is to ask for help.  I'm sure that you know that we have amazing help rooms filled with folks who are ready to answer questions.  Sometimes you just need to ""prime the pump"", so to speak.  

FCC Is definitely for novice coders . . . some just find the transition between the more ""hand holding"" parts of the challenges to the ""You're on your own"" parts more difficult than others. Being frustrated is not actually a bad thing and you shouldn't back away from it.  Frustration is just a sign that you don't understand something.  The key is narrowing it down to what precisely you don't understand and seeking help - either with web searches, other resources, or seeking help."

The tutorials up until Basic JavaScript were very useful. I learned an incredible amount, and everything was very accessible to understand, even as an extreme novice. Until 2 months ago, I had never even written a line of HTML. 

JavaScript is killing me. I went through the basic tutorial twice because I felt like I hadn't paid enough attention the first time when things started getting difficult. The second time through, I took, what I thought to be, pretty good notes. And then I got stuck again in the same spot. I tried a bit to read through outside sources to better help me understand things, but it felt pointless. 

With these bonfire challenges, the only thing that seemed understandable was ""Reverse a String."" From there, as well as a few of the chapters in Basic JavaScript, I haven't been able to get through a challenge on my own. I'll read outside sources, attempt to apply what I've read (it makes no sense even after I've read a few things), and work on a problem for a few hours. After that, I get unbelievably frustrated, look up the solution on waypoint, and see that I wasn't even close to solving the problem. That's not an exaggeration. It's embarrassingly no where near a possible solution. 

I've read a few things that say FCC is great for intermediate coders, or someone who has already learned an advanced language. Should I, as a complete novice, put FCC aside for a while, go through codecademy, and then come back after? I really like FCC and the community, and the idea, but I'm losing my mind. Any advice? "

If you're pulling it from a CDN, there is a pretty good chance it's a positive cache hit, so the overhead is low.

There is no question that we could stand to improve our coverage of APIs.  We have some infrastructure requirements to enable that, though.

GitHub has a polyfill (https://github.com/github/fetch) for the browsers that don't support it.

First, some key sections could use more explanation. I'm thinking Javascript Functions, Accessing Objects Properties with Variables, Testing Objects for Properties and Jquery (which was good but just really light and gives one the illusion of being competent). Second, I think it might be be wise to have the option of a second or third portfolio project for Bootstrap. I know it's only one component but it seems like we flirt with fluency but don't seem to get there.

The more exposed you are to different facets of life or in this specific case computing the easier it is to find novel solutions to problems. You can think of experience tuning the heuristic we use for problem solving.

unless it's a problem we've seen before and already know the answer to, we don't know if an idea we came up with is either 0 completely right
10 completely wrong.

I actually got that Unicode is an integer representation of a given character, and I have an idea of how to approach this problem, what I don't understand is why you can't just throw it in a for loop and get back a string translated from characters into integers (and what unicode actually IS.) Mozilla gives you code for the for loop further down the page but not a very in-depth explanation of what the code is actually doing. I feel like a breakdown of the deeper underlying structures and terminology are just not there, and that I'm getting further and further along with little holes in the foundation of my knowledge that I'm not sure how to fill because I don't even know what they are.  I went into this course knowing that it's not for beginners, and I prefaced it by doing the entire Codecademy JavaScript curriculum first, but it's like there's no middle ground between that (very easy) and this (very hard) and it seems like there should just be a lesson on stuff like Unicode. And @tuningmind I agree - this is the single best method I've found too, and again, I'm truly appreciative that it's here. Possibly I'm just venting out of frustration with my own learning issues. If there is another resource that can break stuff like this down into language that parse-able for people that have limited background....I'd love to know about it and stop bugging all of you.

I'm wondering if difficult spots in the curriculum are being obscured because some percentage of people are running into a wall and then copying code from codepen.  

When I got stuck and had put over 20 hours on a less-directed project, I indulged in a peek at someone else's code, just to get an idea what else to look for. It's complex enough to feel like a valid learning strategy. I wonder whether either the exercise or its time estimate could be adjusted using those answers. For example, maybe the time estimate should be longer; maybe some of that code can be either provided or hinted at; maybe a hint button can be provided after a certain amount of editing. "

I'm not sure if it's an issue of a particular section as much as not understanding how to apply the skills learned from the lessons before ""Counting Cards."" Both times that I've tried to get through the basic javaScript section, I hit a wall at ""Counting Cards"" and on. 

For example, in the ""Testing Objects for Properties"" chapter, I'm completely lost as to how the function 
```js
function checkObj(checkProp)
```

can recognize that 

```js
gift: ""pony"",
  pet: ""kitten"",
  bed: ""sleigh""
``` 

can recognize that pony, kitten, and sleigh are properties. Using this as an example, it doesn't feel like there was ever mention that the ""checkProp"" could do just that. 

To explain further, if I were to write this:
```js

var myConfusion = {
  what: ""are"",
  you: ""talking"",
  about: ""?""
};

function checkObj(checkProp)
```
Would this have the same result as the solution in the chapter? 

I'm sorry if my question is confusing or long-winded. I'm just trying to be very clear, haha.

Now, if FCC were to outright state that from ""Counting Cards"" and on, the examples will be entirely different, then I wouldn't be as annoyed or frustrated because I would know what to expect.

The thing is I don't know what I don't know so I can't really say what is missing from that section of the curriculum but at least from my limited experience with it just the last 2 days, I don't understand how to properly  form the API calls within functions, Once I finally do manage to pull from the API I then don't know how to for example extract a part of the data (for example an image ID) then append that data back into a URL in my HTML to then go retrieve an image. Not only that because I don't fully understand what I'm actually using and calling, I don't even know what to google to learn more. So Really I'd just like to suggest an expansion on the JSON & AJAX API section ;)

I’ve been trying to think up a lesson for it, but it’s not an easy topic.
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2016-03-08T20:43:59.034Z	54ee77ff15522ed4b3dc7cbb	SaintPeter	56df398fa54928411669784c	@ltegman Many/most of the earlier challenges use globals because it's way easier to write tests for them.  Also because about half the curriculum is pre-function.
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2016-03-08T20:43:09.104Z	55863c8015522ed4b3e23814	ltegman	56df395db0cc3f1b41512d14	@SaintPeter A user suggested that second idea once, but a lot of our earlier challenges use global variables (or do they? maybe they’re all wrapped in a top/tail function?)

Just some food for thought in case you can come up with a way for us to emphasize that to students.

We don't directly teach it, but simply reading them and getting used to where the information is and how it is prestented is important.  Reading docs is something you'll need to do throughout your career as a web dev.
w3schools only presents the most superficial possible overview of most functions.  I don't recommend them for anything but remembering the order of the parameters."

I request the *new* waypoints under Basic JavaScript should be re-positioned within the curriculum to a new section (perhaps ""Intermediate JavaScript"") as they are not really required to complete the Basic Algorithm scripting challenges and, they are much more complex than the original set.  

Personally, I was 70% complete with the Basic Algorithm section when these new waypoints were added and I found them to be quite confusing.  "

One idea is to just fork Owasps NodeGoat. Which is probably the best tool out there to teach Node Security. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Node_js_Goat_Project
And based on NodeGoat we can rewrite the text to make it more beginner-friendly and then create challenges for each vulnerability. 
An example of a challenges could be: Patch the code for Server Side JS Injection (changing eval to JSON.parse), ensure that all dependencies are secure (run nsp), fix de misconfigured header."

It's a shame though, the lack of concern about security issues. I think it should have a more central role in the teaching of web-dev. I just learned recently that MongoDB has no user authentication by default. Which means that anyone that uses mongodb out of the box publish his/her db open to anyone. Feels like something that new coders should be aware of."

From my perspective, the target audience of FCC probably wouldn't be active in this type of discussion, save for the people that hang out in chat with prior experience.

I just felt like in the main channel it is kind of hard to have discussions. And help-javascript seem more appropriate for algorithm-problems or js-related issues.
But I suppose back-end could be the appropriate channel for it, although not all security-issues are back-end related."

How do we write code to prevent XSS, CSRF, or NoSQL injections. Or how to hash passwords in node, or how to encrypt sensitive data.

I am talking only about JavaScript and the way how ECMAScript standards 5.1 and 6 define these concepts.

To differentiate between my opinions and what is stated on the standards, I present first the relevant chapters I found on the standards:

ECMAScript 6/24.3  The JSON Object
The JSON object is the %JSON% intrinsic object and the initial value of the JSON  property of the global object. 
The  JSON  object is a single  ordinary  object that contains two functions,  parse  and  stringify, that are used to 
parse  and  construct  JSON  texts.  The  JSON  Data  Interchange  Format  is  defined  in  ECMA-404.  The  JSON 
interchange format used in this specification is exactly that described by  ECMA-404.
Conforming  implementations  of  JSON.parse  and  JSON.stringify  must  support  the  exact  interchange 
format described in the ECMA-404 specification without any deletions or extensions to the format. 

ECMAScript 5.1/5.1.5  The JSON Grammar
The JSON grammar is used to translate a  String describing a set of ECMAScript objects into actual objects. 
The JSON grammar is given in 15.12.1.
The  JSON  grammar  consists  of  the  JSON  lexical  grammar  and  the  JSON  syntactic  grammar.  The  JSON 
lexical grammar is used to translate character sequence s into tokens and is similar to parts of the ECMAScript 
lexical  grammar. The  JSON  syntactic  grammar  describes  how  sequences  of  tokens from  the  JSON  lexical 
grammar can form syntactically correct JSON object descriptions.

ECMAScript 6/24.3.1 JSON.parse ( text [ , reviver ] ) 
The  parse  function parses a JSON text (a JSON-formatted String) and produces an ECMAScript value. The 
JSON format  is  a  subset  of  the  syntax  for  ECMAScript  literals,  Array  Initializers  and  Object  Initializers.  After 
parsing,  JSON  objects  are  realized  as  ECMAScript  objects.  JSON  arrays  are  realized  as  ECMAScript  Array
instances. JSON strings, numbers, booleans, and null are realized as  ECMAScript Strings, Numbers, Booleans, 
and null.

---------------------

My conclusions about terminology:
JSON format = Text or string format for describing objects. Subset of the syntax of ECMAScript literals.
JSON objects = Objects inside JSON format text or string describing a set of ECMAScript objects.
ECMAScript objects = Can be parsed from JSON text (a JSON formatted string). Are in computer memory and references can be stored in variables.

---------------------

My other thoughts:
Although I still consider it a bad way to teach JSON by using JSON format object literals, my main critique is the incorrect terminology in these exercises:
      
Introducing JavaScript Object Notation JSON:
""JavaScript Object Notation or JSON uses the format of JavaScript Objects to store data."" should be ""uses the format of Javascript object literals to store data on text"", and the differences between JSON syntax and Javascript object literal syntax should be explained. 
""Here is an example of a JSON object"" should be ""Here is an example of a Javascript object created by object literal in JSON format"".

Accessing Nested Objects in JSON/Accessing Nested Arrays in JSON:

These exercises talk about accessing JSON objects with bracket or dot notation. 
That is totally wrong. JSON objects are structures inside JSON format text or string. Exercises actually deal with accessing Javascript objects created by JSON format object literals. 
Accessing JSON objects in this case would mean changing the text inside the object literal. That is not what is being done in these exercises.

I think that when people do these exercises they are left confused about what JSON is and how it relates to JavaScript objects and object literals, and how JSON is used."

For other languages this is probably true, where there is no direct internal representation of the JSON data.  In JS, though, there is a direct correlation.

The goal would be to add another object to the JSON string. There might be `var myMusic = JSON.parse(myMusicJSON);` after it telling that it is turned into JS object and maybe something could be done with the JS object.

JSON is a grammar for turning JS objects into a string and vice versa. If you talk about JSON or JSON objects, they are inside a string (or text communication). JSON syntax is similar to JS object literal syntax with somewhat more strict syntax rules. That doesn't make object literals JSON. Accessing and manipulating JSON or JSON objects means string manipulation.

JSON is a grammar for turning a string into JS objects (or text format for transmitting data objects). Exercises talk about JSON objects and using them. Those are actually JS objects created by object literals. The fact that you can write object literals with more strict syntax so that they could be a part of JSON string, doesn't make them JSON. Exercises teach close to nothing about JSON and in my opinion are likely to mostly confuse people.

I think that what an IDE is is sort of blurry anyway.  I did see that there is a nice node.js debugger for Atom.  Of course you can debug web stuff with Chrome.

I've been using atom  for a few weeks now and Im loving it. You can install a package called JSHint which will report syntactical errors.

Security is not optional - everyone should at least know the basic threats and be able to protect well against them!

Since I'm far from an expert on Node.js- or clientside-JS-security it'll be fun to leave my comfort zone and learn new things, both about contributing to a project like this but also about security if course! :)
However, I hope to find a couple of collaborators that I can learn from so I don't have to work through this on my own. I've started to realise how much work this will involve since I'm just about green when it comes to security... :D"

I'm not very familiar witht he bulneravilities other than using `.env` for variables with sensitive infomration like port, mongo uri, api keys, admin username which are the cases I have used and making sure they are not saved on git, and scrubbing the github history the one time I did saved the info on git

I used to believe that there were some people who were ""programmer material"" and others who simply were not.  My time at FCC has shown me that here are really only ""people who keep going"" and ""people who give up"".  I firmly believe that anyone CAN learn to program if they're willing to put the time into it.  There are plenty of studies (about learning in general, not programming specifically) that show that pretty much anyone can learn anything if they're willing to put in the time."

I agree, at some point the scope needs to expand, the developer needs to learn to teach themselves and plan their own creations. But this challenge comes right on the heels of JS algorithm challenges, which are not really helpful for this challenge. If you expand the scope too quickly, I think you run the risk of

I saw someone’s profile the other day that was way beyond my knowledge and it just made me want to learn all about the stuff they used to make it so that I could do something just as cool. And honestly, I think that portfolio sets a pretty low bar. If you want to impress people while job hunting you’ll need something better than that. (and the background effect isn’t true parallax, so it doesn’t need JS)

They are also not necessary. The reason they aren't taught directly is because it's a bit hard for us to get that working as a challenge in one site. You are also completely allowed to use other resources to learn techniques and layouts that you like. It'd be impossible to cover everything and being able to look at something and then figuring out how to do it. (which most of the time requires a lot of googling of help from a more seasoned developer) It's important to be given a blank canvas at some point and be allowed to figure it out. Using the chat room, google or pairing is an awesome way to do any challenge

I have been reading over the code and it is blowing my mind. At my current skill level it is going to take me a lot of time to unpack what is going on in these 780 lines of code. I think a website example that is a little simpler, like the cat page that was worked on in the examples would be much less intimidating. Having that website as an example is just discouraging for someone like me. But I will do my best to hack something together and keep plugging along. Thanks for the thorough response.

#Waypoint: Selecting from many options with Switch Statements

If you have many options to choose from, use a `switch` statement. A `switch` statement tests a value and can have many `case` statements which defines various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched `case` value until a `break` is encountered.

Here is a `pseudocode` example:

```js
switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  case valueN:
    statementN;
    break;
}
```

I added an article to the wiki and now some small cosmetic errors were found. I'm fixing them as we speak by syncing my fork with the latest wiki changes and creating a new branch to fix the issues. I also see however that there is a branch called cleanup ...should I PR against wiki master or that cleanup branch since this is essentially cleaning up? :)

and also, I did the data visualization certificate step but I didn't get the certificate, did I not pass tests or something? I checked my d3 code and I must have used same tuts/examples because code is very similar for some of them, but if the camper above could get the data viz just wondering why I didn't.

Yeah I think you may be right about it being overkill for this, but it would definitely solve the problem. Maybe we can put these on hold for a while until we see the complexity of implementing those tests and if it’s not too bad move some of the vanilla CSS to that style as necessary?

Currently all projects in FCC are manually peer reviewed. Why dont we setup an automatic grader which will test each user stories? For example the API projects can be easily tested for compliance of user stories + some edge cases. React projects can also be tested thanks to its superior test framework. 
The ideal scenario would be : user completes a project, posts the Github link of the project in the FCC portal. A bot then pulls the repo and starts testing, and provides feedbacks. "

I am going to share some discussion I had with @QuincyLarson a while ago.

I have already shared these with @SaintPeter and @AkiraLaine in the morning (Indian time!)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have always felt that the instructions, when it comes to projects (Front end projects, back end projects, React projects) are not clearly provided. In the earlier lessons, they are told clearly what to do, and the steps to achieve that.

But in the project, the directions to the camper typically ends with a demo of the application, user stories / features required and a warning to not look at the source code of the sample.

While the intentions are indeed noble, it's not very helpful to people who have never built a project. People try to tackle the whole problem at once, getting nowhere. What is more important, is to transfer the user requirement / user stories to step-by-step development checkpoints. Kind of like how to build a simple static version, and add more features to it.

I propose that we do it like this: instead of just giving them the user stories, in the first few projects, also give them directions on how to break down the work, how to go about implementing each of the user stories.

The instructions would be less detailed as one progresses through the tracks. In time, a camper should be able to break down a project into steps like these on their own, and be able to predict more reliably when he can deliver.

If you think about it, this is also a plus at software engineering jobs. Anyone who can deliver their projects on time, predict up front how long would a project would take or even what could potential bottlenecks be - is an asset of an employee to have.

Let me provide an example of what kind of direction I would expect from the FCC description of the project problem. 
Say, for instance, one user story says ""User should not be able to comment without logging in"". 

How does one implement it step-by-step?

This is how I would normally do it:
- Create a new Git branch
- Use `npm install` to install the login modules, something like `passport`
- Write small code snippet in server side files to check if the user is logged in before comment is inserted in DB
- Test this feature and ensure not logged-in user gets an error.
- Test this feature and ensure logged-in user does not get an eror, and comment is successfully inserted in DB and displayed on the UI.
- Now, add some extra functionality in the else clause. If user is not logged in, don't throw an error. Instead, take him to log-in route. Once they log-in, put the comment in DB and display on the UI.
- Test this new feature.
- Test more rigorously with different browsers and maybe even a phone or tablet connected to same network.
- Commit
- Write automated test cases with Phantom and Mocha.
- Run test suite.
- Push on GitHub and let a Travis build take place.
- If all goes fine, merge the branch to devel and delete the local branch.

This kind of step-by-step instruction can be there in the first few projects. Later projects might have less hand-holding.

This would also help them get familiar with GitHub issue tracker, Milestone maintainer, labels etc. No matter where the camper gets a job; they would have some internal bug filing system and bug levels such as P1, P2, P3 etc.

Experience with tools and processes would also be an asset worth mentioning in a resume."

Also,  I make the user create a variable ```$text-color``` and change the value of ```.blog-post h3``` to ```$text-color```. I added some more HTML content so that they can see the bigger picture."

Sass as a pre-processor is something you should be using in every large project, so you use it in the SASS challenges and then also in the react projects. Not sure if it's really needed in the D3 projects though, seems like a bit of an overkill.

If this is true, then why only have tutorials on React? Why not have tutorials on multiple frameworks and let the student pick which they want to use for the project? I know this would be time consuming to create but it would expose the student to more before going out to get a job.

So I hope I am not doubleposting: It appears that after the beautiful makeover, all my solutions from the previous assignments have been deleted. The credit are still there (that I have passed), but it seems I have lost the solutions I had as a reference. It is such a shame really... as I would like to go back once in a while (quite often actually) to remember how I overcome a similar obstacle earlier...

The best possible solutions should maybe in the tips given in each asignment. But then again, the assignment references are only a guide to some of often many possible solutions. To search up an even better independent solution than the proposed ones, should be (and I would guess are in fact) encouraged. I don't think I have solved even half of the assignments using the tips straight out of the box. The resources out there are great, maybe especially stackoverflow - daunting at first, but once you learn to combine the answers there with straight mozilla-references, you are fine. I hope updating the assignments with even better references is an easy task @SaintPeter . Cheers all!

54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2016-01-18T20:21:41.402Z	54ee77ff15522ed4b3dc7cbb	SaintPeter	569d495504e908d302c3dc9c	@keccakec You can do `arr.slice(0, howMany)` or `arr.splice(howMany)`

The .splice() method seems easier (as far as I can tell), and it's the first real experience you get with it in the curriculum, so encouraging people to go for the solution that way seems like a good way to introduce the function.

However long term it would better to shift it to markdown format or a wiki style entry on Github. Githubs issue tickets may also be good for the discussion. You can make a proposal and put it up for discussion.

It would either need to be able to be integrated with FCC or be able to authenticate through it to access user information. It would also need a highly defined plan so that people working on it know what needs to be done.

On a side note, a project like this that is expected to be maintained by the community could have publicly available design documents that could be available to campers as en example. For instance start with a Request for Proposal from a customer (FCC) and then fill out documentation with use cases, mockups, diagrams etc like you would use internally or provide to the customer."

Even the town 50miles north has one, but last meet up was in sept with no furture one in site. I would love online study/project groups as an alterative to whats going on facebook.

An interesting project for Campers once we hit a certain level would be a a project maintained by the community itself that addresses an issue that the students face.

For instance, it would be great to have an online app where people can find or create study groups. 

* Users can create or find study groups based on times available and language
* User count can be capped at a certain level.
* Users can be removed from groups for inactivity by the group owner
* A private area for the group to plan problems prior to the actual session

This would be great for users like myself who live in a deadzone so to speak. The closest facebook group is a couple hundred miles away. Finding people online is really the only alternative but finding people that are all available at the same time is difficult to say the least."

There appears to be an issue with multiple Waypoints—I'm not sure how far back it goes, because I haven't been tracking it for that long—but it affects at least all the comparison and logical operator Waypoints in the JS sequence. The issue is that the checkpoints (i.e. the green checkmarked test points) don't come up until an answer is submitted, making it very difficult to tell which criteria we're trying to satisfy. All that's visible when we start the Waypoint is the console box with its various disclaimers.

Also, the logical operator Waypoints want us to replace the arguments when the function is run, but they don't tell us which response they want the function to return, so we have to guess from context. That's easy enough with the earlier ones, but it gets harder when we get to the && and || operators."

I am currently making an overview of 1. the knowlegde I gathered by reading 'Node.JS in action' and watching some YouTube tutorials 2. the exercises and information provided by NodeSchool and 3. the skeleton of what I would have liked to learn and in which order. When I finish this, I shall give an update here. It just tasks some more days. And then I hope some of you jump in, or I jump in a running part of the project or whatsoever, at least I hope that there will be some follow-up. If not, then I see this exercise as a nice way to teach myself some node... besides, in my next post

@/all - Do you have what it takes?
Caesar is dead . . . the Checkpoint, that is.  He has ascended to the Bonfire section, becuase he was just too hard.  That leaves us with a gap!  We need a new Checkpoint to fill the void!
### Caesar Replacement Details
* Must use object lookups
* Must use for loops
* Should probably use an array that is looped over

Give me an idea and/or solution code and/or a description and it will be the basis for a new Checkpoint.
### Regex Checkpoint
We also need a checkpoint for after the Regex content.  It needs to use the material covered in the Regex section . . . and not be too hard.  It's a Checkpoint, not a Bonfire."

The first time I saw it, it didn’t really matter to answering the question but the second it was more necessary to know what it meant. Though saying “word blanks” made it clearer. I have since asked my wife, (an American),  so now I know the reference now but I’m sure a large number of campers will wonder.

And there is value in following convention, which is what postfix is. It introduces some confusion because you’re introducing two new syntax instead of one.

Why would it add any confusion? And prefix being rarely used is not a good reason to keep the campers in *dark*. And readability is not an issue. 
There are two ways of writing. They can choose whatever they want. "

It introduces confusion and prefix increment/decrement is very rarely used, which makes it less readable than postfix.

> Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.
**Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope**. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with var.
**Instructions**
Declare a *global* variable `myGlobal` outside of any function. Initialize it to have a value of 10

So to declare a global variable, i did
```js
// Declare your variable here
myGlobal = 10;
```

Now the tests are frowning
```text
myGlobal should be declared using the var keyword
```

Why? The description said
> variables without `var` keyword can create global. 

And then it said, 
> it might have unintended consequences.

But since the instruction asked for it, that means it was intentional. And to create a global variable, I don't have to use `var`. And then walla!! The test is asking to make a global using `var` ... WHAT!! 

**And also I don't understand what to conclude from doing this waypoint.** :(
cc: @terakilobyte Any comments for improving the description?

Let's learn about the most basic data structure of all: the Boolean. Booleans can only hold the value of either true or false. They are basically little on-off switches.

**Data Structures or Data types?**

I really like it, eh? Specially the slope. I got now what ranking means... I would try to be more explicit with what ranking means (you have space in the graph to do write that...) or use another word.

The information to get what the chart is about could be more clear, I think...: one relevant sentence is hidden in a subtitle... can you make the ""Fastest Times blablabla"" a bit bigger or visible? Or a subjective title, like ""Climbing the Doping Times"" or anything hat speaks about the trend of the curve to catch the attention, and then a more descriptive subtitle (so you are forced to read to get the details)?... 

Maybe can try changing names by years?  Or add the year by... I have the impression that we are going to see clusters.... It seems that the best times attributed to doping were at some time between mid 1990-mid 2000.... I am not sure. Not sure if relevant...

I like the ""slope"" feeling of the points, like climbing a mountain... it would be also interesting to add a flag of the country of origin.... what is ""ranking""? I believe year variable could add some valuable info, but maybe playing against the ""climbing"" feeling? What if you make years along the x axis and make that axis at an angle then? "

I was then wondering: is the challenge also involving the manipulation of additional data variables so they can also recreate different viz's to their personal taste and discovery?

- 6 are done-done.
- 7 are in-progress
- 2 haven’t yet been started. I am looking for volunteers to tackle these two React/Sass challenges:
https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/5147
https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/5152
Ideally, we wnat to finish these by Dec 27 so so I have a few days to create API endpoints on FCC (to remove the need for including API keys on CodePen), to host necessary JSON files, and to record the videos for their video Waypoints challenges."

You are correct, all of the bonus stories have been converted to requirements.  We had a number of questions and uncertainty about these ""bonus"" stories and we believe they were causing more confusion than they were worth.  This is also in line with our overall philosophy that we have a ""single path"" through our content."

User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

User Story: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

Thanks,

I have sort of started to get it organized.
———————


an idea for a D3 .. now I have to learn it too but well..  I’d like to see what you think about it before I kill myself doing it lol.

It’s basically a view of the Camper News. 
Cuts out having to learn a new content area just to do the task.
I’d like to try  a  Force-Directed Graph  maybe  a curved one like this     http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4600693
The News is the root with authors and their articles as the nodes . The author node could increase in size with the number of articles they have published and perhaps the article nodes could be color coded to show how many up votes they have . there would be some cross connections as often different authors link to the same article. Hovering could reveal author info or article info.
I really have no idea right now how to do this,  but it’s our data, easy API (no rate limit/keys), easy to understand what’s going on. It’s not a mapping demo  as we have that already. 
it would be more like this I guess

I’ve been looking at some Kepler (space telescope) data about exoplanets and have found some great stuff using that and D3. Some of it is classifying and visualizing planet types  and the other, their orbits. Though the orbits are a bit CSS heavy.

FCC might not be prone to encourage political- or religious-related topics though, not because they are not important but because it prefers to keep a more neutral approach... In that sense, if you are interested in politics or religious or similar, just keep it neutral and impartial: some changes in demographics for example could be fine, I guess... Better to consult...

Meteorite landings & earthquake epicenters are both graduated circle maps and without a legend they might look the same. but if you can tell a story with it, or combine 2 data sets...say earthquakes overlying some type of fracking data...or a time series of earthquake patters before & after frackign...those are interesting stories and would add meanign behind the dots.

I can already tell that there are thigns that will need to be at least introduced such as webpack or browserify, gulp, and one that I have been hearing is hwo to deploy on heroku. I tried without success.

It's important that a developer is as vast as can be. That makes him less of a commodity. @SaintPeter  @P1xt  @AdventureBear  @Smangeee  @evaristoc  @Smangeee the goal here is to make the curriculum as effective as possible. We will revisit these issues time and again, that's for sure. Eventually, we might tailor the course map on the basis of objectives and location. Those two seem quite viable. Case in point, reading Terry McNavage's JavaScript for Absolute Beginners and I assure you, for an ambitious person in the certain developing places, an ice cream is almost never heard of. Telling him there's different flavours of it adds salt to injury. Result? Giant gaps in knowledge. Side effect? It slows them down.

Unfortunately there is no way to force the challenge map to update, it is read into memory at startup.  What I did was put a bunch of stubs in, then filled them in using COM.

Does anyone know how to count cards for Blackjack?  I have questions about it that [Wikipedia on Card Counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_counting) is not making clear.  I'd love to chat briefly on Skype with someone ""in the know"".  This is for a ""Mini-Bonfire""

If I knew how to count cards I woudl not be learning programming XD"

Hence it'd be good to have one or two with just Node/Express and one or two with some Mongo/Mongoose too?

The ability to pick up knowledge in new areas and apply it is a critical job skill.  As for Golf being elitist . . . well, I'd rather work for people who have the money. ;)   

From my personal perspective,  I can tell you that making mini-bonfires is quite challenging.  I have to come up with a challenge that is ""real world"", fairly specific to the preceding material, and simple enough to be explained in just a few sentences.  Neither of the two challenges actually require domain specific knowledge of either Golf or Blackjack - everything you need to solve both problems is wholly contained in the challenge description.  If I wanted, I could make it about imaginary games with imaginary terms . . . but there is a good chance that our primarily American audience will be at least passingly familiar with these games."

However, I'd counter with the fact that I've actually (personally) worked on websites for someone who sells golf supplies AND a gaming site where you could play blackjack or poker. I think the important thing is not so much to come up with challenges that everyone can relate to, but rather to come up with a wide variety of varied challenges to give learners experience across many different topics. Regardless where they happen to be, or their current socioeconomic situation, the campers are here because they want to be web developers, eventually for pay. And, once you enter the ""for pay"" arena, you're developing whatever app the client wants, and the clients are going to want all sorts of things you're not familiar with ...

Without making it ridiculously complex, wouldn't it be appropriate to know what cards the player has and hit, bet, or hold based on the relative number of high/low cards in the deck. For instance, if I had a 15, I wouldn't necessarily hold if I knew most the high cards were already out of the deck, I'd be tempted to gamble and ask the dealer to hit me before I hold.

For each of the 5 D3 Ziplines, we choose a visualization type that looks compelling (https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) and recommend a dataset (http://www.data.gov/ or host a JSON file ourselves on FCC)

The campers can use our recommended dataset or find a dataset with similar features to use instead, but they will need to use the specific type of D3 visualization we recommend."

https://fcctwitter-hermanfassett.c9users.io/
The hardest part was getting the auth credentials :P and for some reason I can't search hashtags... Trying to figure out why atm. Also, there's a rate limit and I use requests to both search and format (embed really) each individual tweet, so it might show Rate limit exceeded much too often. Just needs time to recover from that.
If this isn't what you're thinking it's just fine, it's been good for me to practice my server stuff (and yes I used Angular)"

As you probably noticed, this is a bit of a free-for-all. My goal is to quickly decide what we need to build, and get everything into GitHub issues.

- 5 React/SASS Ziplines
- 5 D3.js Ziplines (maybe 4 - @storbeck’s Zipline looks quite close to finished)
- 5 API/Microservice Basejumps (preferably built on top of Clementine.js)

So let’s all figure out exactly what needs to be built (preferably from a set of agile user stories like on the existing Ziplines/Basejumps) and create GitHub issues for them. I’ve already created a milestone to assign them to: jan2016"

It all depends what you want the user to be able to do and what story the map is telling

Squeeze the sizes together again...maybe try the squares or a 2.2 exponent or 2.4 exponent

Adding detial in this case say the US, would mean making the range of circle sizes much smaller so you can discern the details of where each one landed and how big they are relative to other US hits, instead of just one giant mass of landings.

I have a degree in cartography, but it's over 20 years old.   One thing to consider is limiting the number of circle sizes to ones that  people can discern.  five is a good number, and each one would be a range of mass sizes.  Experimenting with the diameter of the circles to visually represent the differences is also not a new ""problem"".  I recall off-hand that scaling the area of the circle by the square of the value appears to humans as a doubling.  So a circle representing 100 vs 200 would have the square root of the area.  Not sure tha tmakes sense. "

The main thing we need is self directed individuals.  If you see a need, fill it.  If you want to review our curriculum and see if there are obvious gaps or opportunities, great, let us know.  As you're going through the material, take notes or file issues when you see a problem.  If you're feeling up to it, write a PR.

@gotrhythm88 - If you're interested in jQuery, you could potentially spec out areas that you think we should have the curriculum cover.  Even a list of challenges (waypoints) with a logical progression would be a good start.  We can farm out writing the actual descriptions and tests to other folks."

# Welcome New People!
Wow, so exciting to see so many people interested in Curriculum Development!  I'm wondering if you all have specific ideas about what areas you'd like to contribute in, or if you're looking for direction.

### Who is that guy?
I've come on the FCC staff as a Cirriculum Developer, and my current focus is on building up the Basic Javascript Curriculum.  You can [see here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OfnXh3p0XZ7hCE0EFJOQlA8YTst7MH0GVyGJ43URj4E/edit?usp=sharing) the prep work I did for the Basic Javascript revamp.  The actual work is [ongoing here](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/feature/basic-javascript-revamp/seed/challenges/basic-javascript.json).

### Getting up to speed
We will definitely need help on the new content we're creating, but we can also use cleanups, expansions, and rewrites of existing material.  If you want to start our small, you can check for [Help Wanted Tags](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/labels/help%20wanted) on our Issues list.  [Writing PRs](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/How-To-Create-A-Pull-Request-for-Free-Code-Camp) can be a great way to get up to speed with the underlying format of our material. 

### Need Help?
If you have questions or need help with the actual nuts and bolts of doing PRs, check the [HelpContributors Room](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/HelpContributors).

### Discuss away!
This is the room for discussion.  Bring your ideas, bring your plans.  Let us know what you're interested in doing and we'll see what we can do to support you."

React + SASS Ziplines:
- Choose your own adventure game
- Conway's game of life
- Calendar (with Google Calendar API?): https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/?hl=en
- Alternate Twitter Interface (tweet, read stream, search)
- Gitter client (using Gitter's API)

For each of the 5 D3 Ziplines, we choose a visualization type that looks compelling (https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery) and recommend a dataset (http://www.data.gov/ or host a JSON file ourselves on FCC)

API + Microservice Basejumps 
- Photo API (maybe pulling data from imagur?)
- API on top of one of the large .gov datasets
- Microservice that involves sockets / pubsub
- other ideas?

Once we’ve firmed these ideas up, we can create GitHub issues and assign them to people. We plan to coordinate the creation of these challenges completely on GitHub (no Trello this time).

For each challenge we need:
1) A working demo (should minimize the number of tools from outside those covered in our curriculum) - on CodePen for Ziplines, and on Heroku/GitHub for full stack challenges
2) Agile user stories (I can help you write these once I see the demo)"

The OOP course is very good in describing scoping, this-word, and classes. Maybe that can help you to find something... I haven't seen the functional one, but I am certain it is as good as the OOP course.

I still find the description in the PR confusing, but I think my attempt to be more clear is probably too wordy. Examples tend to make things clear so if people are reading the test cases, that should be enough.

On a side note, I feel like the way to be  most clear is to turn the description into pseudo-code, and that I need to fight myself to stay away from that.  It's not easy to figure out how/how much help to give people, and I admire the way you guys seem to find the right line to walk."

I see why there are issues.  At any rate, here's my crack at an improvement.

*Current instructions:*
“Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument). Return the truncated string with a ""..."" ending. Note that the three dots at the end add to the string length. If the length of the string is less than or equal to 3 characters, then the length of the three dots is not added to the string length.”

*PR:*
Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument). Return the truncated string with a ""..."" ending. Note that the three dots at the end add to the string length. If num is less than or equal to 3, then the length of the three dots is not added to the string length.""

*My Suggestion:*
“Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument). Return the truncated string with a ""..."" ending. Length of the returned string including the three dots should not exceed the maximum string length, except where `num` is less than or equal to 3.  In that case, add the three dots to the total length of the returned string.”"

I think having the edge case in there is not a bad thing, since programming often involves considering edge cases. I don't know if the confusion is coming from it just being the first time students encounter a weird edge case like that or from the description actually being confusing.

Their behavior is also rather similar so this is not all that much a problem; the user will at least know its a clickable element. my div example would just render as text. some esoteric combination of css, js and html might cause the screenreader to say 'clickable' if you're very lucky, but hoping for that is dangerous

So addition of an ARIA role would be a better choice.

- Why does accessibility even matter? )talk about what advantages it has, when the laws about it will affect you etc)
- Access 101 (talk about proper heading structure, alt tags, some other really simple things you can do to make your site work well)
- Accessibility and JavaScript (careful where you inject stuff in the DOM, make sure your intereactive stuff actually works with screenreaders)
- ARIA basics (if you have to deviate from the norm, you can use ARIA to fix your stuff so it works again. Emphasize that this is a fallback option, not a first-class citizen, and give a few examples)
That really is it, more would just be overkill"

The div is meant for sectioning your html content and in HTML5 only if the article, section or things like header/footer do not apply. It is not meant as a replacement for the button element. name, role, value basically means that a screenreader will not know this is even a button, because it says nowhere in the semantics that it is a button. To fix that, you'd have to add an ARIA role and some other things to make it behave like a button, which is often far more work than just using a regular button element where this is already done for you. It may seem involved, but this will get your company a 27000-dollar fine (per day) if they're in the right branch and someone complains about it

By that time they should have the basics down and be able to understand what we are telling them.

We're trying to break the content into logical ""chunks"" each with their own ""mini-bonfire"" or ""mini-zipline"" associated with it.  So there might be 10-20 waypoints that explore or expand on a single topic, then a little project or problem to exercise those learnings.

I am currently working on adding at least basic accessibility requirements to the html5 and css, bootstrap etc challenges. I keep bumping into things that i'd love to explain a lot further, but I don't think are appropritate for that particular level. For example, in the bit about alt attributes it says ""all images should have alt tags!"" ...thats not strictly true, you can leave the alt out if the image is purely decorative and used for example like a background image ...but I don't think that particular waypoint is the place to talk about that.

You can mix the diferent numbers as it show you the waypoint like you mix paint colors

Hexadecimal includes these 10 numbers, plus the letters A, B, C, D, E and F. This means that Hexidecimal has a total of 16 possible values, instead of the 10 possible values that our normal base-10 number system gives us.

The number beside your picture on Free Code Camp tells you how many Brownie Points you have.

![A user profile picture next to a with Brownie Points score](http://i.imgur.com/SsvbkDH.png)

There are three ways you can get Brownie Points:

1. Complete challenges - you get one point per challenge you complete    
1. Post relevant links on [Camper News](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Camper-News) - you get 1 point for posting a link, and another point for each upvote your link gets    
1. Help other campers in chat - each time you help another camper and they thank you (by typing ""thanks @yourname""), you will get a point    

> Brownie Points help you look like the kind of person who codes a lot, shares relevant links, and helps people. 

*They also add to your [Streak](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/streak/).*

I've forked FCC to my local machine and have it up and running with mongoDB (OS X 10.9).

IMO: regarding ES6, it should be better to create a separate section, probably extended waypoints, instead of forcing people to use it.

Better:
* some bonfires should mention that ES6 is applicable
* why and when it is applicable should be also suggested in the help
* it should be kept optional"

I am not convinced that we don't want users to use built in functions.  Now, `string.prototype.repeat()` is an ES6 function, but it's supported in Chrome and is usable server-side.  I've never heard that ES6 solutions shouldn't be accepted.
The most obvious way to restrict the usage would be a regex looking for `.replace`.  We would also explicitly need to call out NOT to use the build in repeat function in the problem description.
Thoughts?"

Maybe something like:

I certainly agree real world examples  within a single exercise isn't really an easy task. And my comments aren't meant as a slight at all. The independent learning aspect of FCC is one of its strongest points in my opinion, too many online study programs do too much hand holding.

Thinking of building concepts more slowly. Probably something like:
1. Reintroduce Objects (as-is)
2. Contructors (and what `this` means when used in them)
3. Calling constructors with `new`
4. Constructors with parameters for custom object creation.
5. Private variables in contructors with getters and setters

None were TERRIBLY challenging to me, but I liked the puzzle.  I'm interested that you did not.

54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2015-11-05T17:45:46.872Z	54ee77ff15522ed4b3dc7cbb	SaintPeter	563b95ca90e07fcd2e49ad8b	With regards to the Orbital Debris problem, it's true that the equation itself is no great shakes - it's not especially complex - but there are plenty of folks who spend a bit of time working it.  I think the value there is in taking a fairly loose problem description and then turning it into code.  Again, the problem itself is not challenging in and of itself, but the process of solving it is a valuable job skill.

There was one question about an orbit, was just a case of typing out the equation and filling in some variables. There seems to be a lot of questions that essentially revolve around mapping arrays and multiplying or adding the values in comparison to an argument. Something along those lines anyway. And i'm not questioning their value, they're great practice.

They really start to feel like you're just number crunching for the sake of it. Its valuable no doubt but its not great for motivation, there's no sense of what such a thing would be used for, and as they get more complex and users spend more time on them you end up in a situation where you spend a lot of time working something out and you're not entirely sure why.  I don't necessarily think they should be changed but some more context would give the sense that some of the more abstract algorithms are actually useful and the sort of thing you might make use of. Just thought I'd leave some feedback anyway. Thanks!

Potential help menu items:
-suggested documentation links
-maybe links to more info on making sense of run-time errors that pop up, or trigger a Google search of the first error encountered
-Google searches that may have helped others or might be productive when documentation wasn't enough. eg: ""JavaScript timer"" to help with Pomodoro Clock. 
-Ask a question in Gitter
-Copy to Gitter with @SaintPeter's boiler-plate
-copy selection to Gitter 

Sorry, I think some of that involves a lot of work and/or technical challenge, is kind-of vague, and I'm not really sure how it would look. 

I wonder what the process difference typically might be between people who ask for help and people who don't. Are people who don't ask for help doing more Googling? Writing more tests? Do people who ask for help read the documentation but not StackOverflow posts? Is it just personality differences? Is there more attrition with people that have used FCC for a while and ask for help on Gitter or people who don't? ..."

Expanding on that, what if help button somehow pushes you to read first, then search, then ask. Gotta run, but will check in and follow up later. :-)

## Gitter Tool Pallet
### 1)  Copy Solution as Gitter Link 
Precisely as @abhisekp suggested above:  :point_up: [November 1, 2015 4:05 AM](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment?at=56360019ec8422503f8a2d4e) (Sans URL Shortening) - It is definitely Gitter specific, but Gitter is our help platform of choice.
### 2) Copy Solution as Gitter Formatted code.  
Would prepend the ```js and backtick suffix to simplify cuting and pasting a solution for review.  I've also been thinking about adding a waypoint on this, because we burn a lot of time trying to get people to understand this.  It's a waste of helper time and it's a waste of camper time."

Never knew if there was a bug, or if I was missing something. I'm going to assume it was bugs. ;-)

The instruction should clarify the question. And yes, you're right that non-English speakers find test cases more easy to grasp than the instructions.
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2015-10-30T18:54:03.745Z	55e4fb770fc9f982beaf3b79	alan1001110	5633bccb195a24fc65bd5e3a	@abhisekp Personally, I find seeing what the test cases are can help clarify the instructions, and it might be more-so for people who aren't as fluent in English.  Plus, if some test cases don't pass while I'm working through challenges, I often copy and paste the non-passing test case into the bonfire code area and comment out the default test (to find out what the test cases are returning). It also saves some time over typing out console.log lines and bringing up the Devtools. Not sure if that approach was intended. (Also, one challenge I went through a while back had a test-case typing error, so I cheated my way around that instance. :smile: )

I seldom look at the test cases. IMO, instructions are enough for solving a problem. But test cases just add as a catalyst to get to the proper soln. They can also be misused as a hit and trial method of solving the question. And if tests are bad, then the solver gets an improper soln. which will eventually break with the next good test case.

I've experienced the same issue, but I find that the improvements in the test coverage generally make for a better challenge.  Mostly it keeps people from having very poor solutions to some of these bonfires.

Just having a few more eyes on it should have identified tha it was not right and fixed it early.

I just don't think that putting the stuff on beta is that system.

I think that the challenge editor should alleviate some of the issue we have with challenges being broken on release. Also the challenge was still completable it just looked weird. I think the only reason that the challenges were bugged is because they were passed around so much over an extended period of time between myself and Quincy. I think that if I can get the suit testing on the challenge editor working and probably a spell checker also we'll be a lot better placed than we are for creating and self QAing challenges

We can push them out once a week or so, depending on how quickly I finish them.  We can be doing live review on beta while I work on the next batch.

If releasing just two new and one rewritten waypoint has taught me anything, it's that I am as falible as the next guy.

### Thinking about rollouts
I think we should all be a bit embarresed about the the little JSON kerfluffle today.  For whatever reason the lesson code was just embaressingly wrong.  We need to have some sort of active review of these challenges before they go live.  I don't think it's enough for it to pass ""Q/A"", it needs to be viewed by multiple people.

I think our best source of real Q/A is the open source philosophy ""Many eyes make all bugs shallow.""  To that end, I would like to propose the following:

### Release/Review Process
1. New challenges will be pushed to the beta site for a priod of 1 week (or whatever) prior to releasing on the new site. (Maybe with the beta flag set?)
2. A public announcement should be made about the availibility of new content on the beta site, to encourage people to check it out.
3. We work out all of the bugs and first pass feedback on the beta site.
4. Once we're satisfied that the quality of the challenge, we push it live.

This potentially aligns with the proposal that progress on the beta site be mirrored on the live site in some way.  People who help to test the beta versions of challenges should get credit.  "

With the ""Edit Code Here"" links, it would have you inserting a filter in the MIDDLE of a map function?  Also, the output where you're looping though val has one character per div with a class of an index . . I don't even know.  It's totally broken as near as I can tell."

Make sure challenges are in the style of bonfires and not the javascript waypoints. Mainly, campers should be writing their code within a function. This will allow us to do crazy things with testing in the future.

Javascript has lots of immutable types e.g. `string` primitive type. Try this in your console.

```js
s = ""red"";
console.log(s[1]); //→ ""e""
s[1] = ""x"";
console.log(s) //→ ""red""
```
the `s` didn't change! WAT!

### The Issue
We've discussed on several occasions campers's concerns about the changing cirriculum setting them back in their learning.  In particular, with the Front End and Fullstack certificate requirements, adding a new Bonfire/Ziplines/Basejump could be seen as ""unfair"".
### Possible Solution
1. When new content is added that would affect certification requirements, there should be a ""grace period"" of ~1 month or so to allow people who were ""almost done"" to complete their last few Ziplines/Bonfires, etc and get their certificate.  After that period is up, the new challenges would be added to the requirements document/list/whatver.
2. (Not knowing how this currently works) For the Full Stack certification, the pre-req for anything prior to the Front End Cert should just be the Front End Cert itself.  The same grace period would apply."

It would also stop them from outputing to the normal console.log, although if we have a ""Console"" area, that might not be bad overall."

For a number of these tests I think it would be useful to be able to tell the user to output things to the console.  Of course, then the challenge is getting them to understand that doing so is just for the purpose of the challenge, not something one would do ""in real life""."

There are apostrophes all over English, so using single quotes is risky for beginners, especially without linting.
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2015-10-27T05:33:43.342Z	546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c	QuincyLarson	562f0cb7a752d57c01915b43	@SaintPeter regarding best practices, I think we should show them how to do it the quick and dirty way, then have a follow up waypoint that shows them how to do it the proper way. These can just be waypoints. The goal is for them to always be learning by doing, not just reading.

But I’m of the opinion that it should be incorporated directly into the exercise. Something like “refactor this statement to into a one-liner” and you could use the ``return a  === b `` as a hint (we’re building hints into challenges soon)
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2015-10-27T00:18:07.645Z	54ee77ff15522ed4b3dc7cbb	SaintPeter	562ec2bfa752d57c0191567c	"@BerkeleyTrue When we were discussing the curriculum last night he specifically mentioned that he wanted Double Quotes to be the standard.  

I think that these are less ""hints"" and more like ""Best Practices"".  Like my example with the if statement above, I would consider it a best practice to just return the result of the comparison.  I want to to be visually set apart from the body of the waypoint, to indicate that it is advice, not a hard and fast rule of Javascript."

If you want to write some down you can add them as an array under `hints` property in challenges. They will most likely be in the form of modals. FCC’s relationship with quotes is kinda wierd. The codebase is strictly single Q’s unless you have single Q’s in the string, then double Q’s are acceptable. The challenges used to be only single Q’s. @QuincyLarson made a change about two or three months ago to make them all double Q’s. Not sure why. Maybe he can elaborate?

There are 4 ""token"" regular expressions waypoint in Basic Javascript right now.  They are totally insufficient.  I think we need to have an entire Regular Expression sub-section.   To that end, I think we need a new challenge interface, like http://regex101.com - something where you can type a regular expression and have it applied across pre-defined data, with highlighting.  That may be too pie-in-the-sky for right now, but it seems like it would be best in the long run."

* Functional Programming for after this section? Shouldn't be a good idea to make a couple of functional programming exercises just for the student to get a first idea of them?
* The DOM: I haven't check the whole curriculum, but now that we are orienting the training to react, learning to use javascript with the DOM would make more sense than ever..."

Based on our conversation here and from the meeting we had on the 17th, I have done a first pass on a revamp of the ""Basic Javascript"" Cirriculum.  
### Goals
1) Increase the number of topics covered.
2) Break the content into ""chunks"" of similar content, exploring implications
3) Punctuate these chunks with by ""Blank Slate"" challenges I am calling ""Checkpoints""

Currently I have speced out about 25 new Waypoints/Checkpoints.

I have put everything into an editable [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OfnXh3p0XZ7hCE0EFJOQlA8YTst7MH0GVyGJ43URj4E/edit?usp=sharing).  All are welcome to edit/comment.

I am looking for feedback/comments and/or expansions (or contractions) of the proposed content.  I have added ""notes"" to explain the content at a basic level, but the waypoint names (not final) should explain what I'm thinking of.

I am hopeful that we can get some sort of authoring tool support in place to simplify the creation of these waypoints.  I am hopeful that others can participate in writing them."

There's two solutions: meticulously monitor all pairing activity, or not allow random pairing. FCC is moving toward a more unified platform (as can be seen with the in-site chat) but random pairing is something that simply cannot be policed. Having easy on site acces to the lets pair room, now that's manageable. The focus though is building a solid and useful curriculum, not revolutionize the pair programming experience. You have to decide on your plan and stick with it and trying to become the forefront of pair programming would effectively kill the development of the curriculum. To make that comprehensive a pair programming experience, myself, Berkeley and Quincy would all have to down tools and work on the screen sharing app with Wesley. The obvious problem with this is that the site itself would be completely neglected. If you want to shape the future of pair programming on FCC the best thing to do is offer your assistance to @septimus and help create the next screen sharing app.

* About data availability for analysis, it is actually too early to say we DON'T have enough... Wondering if there is not ways to detect emerging patterns in the data as it is available right now... Don't know... We could try to see what it is there that can help... 
* I can see that the vision of FCC is mainly around pairing. I wonder if you have realised that you could likely be after something more comprehensive. I am personally not so interested on the curriculum as I am in the **Learning Platform**, and that includes pairing, chat, etc. You could be after something big in that regard. Again: not even JS but rather what is in my opinion a sui generis emerging community-based Multimedia Learning Platform, in this case focused on JS. 
* In any case, whatever the Platform that emerges, I must say that having a good understanding of the dynamics of that emerging Platform, its parts and how people interact with those parts as a way to facilitate learning could be key for success. Luckily you are listening what people are saying when still possible to make radical changes (it could happens that all could reach a point in which that either won't be that easy or become anarchic... don't know...).
* One of the idea of DataScience room was and still is to gather people and activities that could support what could be called ""best guessed"" decisions. In any case, with or without data there will always be a lot subjectivity and risk in any decision made.

What would we DO with good/bad ratings?  What if someone is a jerk (either in rating or as a partner).  As much as I love this community, we're still all people.  What if someone is ""unpairable""?   Seems like a potential can of worms."

In a ""best case"" scenario both people put forth an equal effort and leave with an equal understanding. In the ""worst case"" one party does the coding and the other gets credit without really understanding what just happened or contributing to the process. This will certainly catch up with the second person at some point if he/she did this willingly  but I could see it happen unwillingly as well if the one who ""does the work"" doesn't take time to truly partner/explain. Maybe this could be mitigated by introducing a karma system for partners as well. For example, as a part of submitting after pairing you also rated the quality of the partner/experience (ex. thumbs up or down or X out of 5 stars), the percent of the work done (ex. one did 40% and the other 60%), etc in order to develop a metric for pairing people or just to encourage an equal distribution of understanding/effort. I'm not saying it'd be easy to implement but it might encourage positive experiences if you walked away with a ""user rating"" attached to you."

IMO, neither pairing nor chat should be seen as fallback: in my view, *BOTH should be part of a solid strategy that will boost the learning*. This is why I was so interested in what it is going on with an overall multimedia format: each media complementing each other in a full learning system.

I don't think that stressing too much one format as THE format would help: there are advantages in pairing, but there are also disadvantages that pairing itself could *never* solve, no matter what you do, but that things like chat or videos or live coding could. So for me it is more about evaluating the impact of each tool and using each accordingly within a solid strategy.

Now: I really like the idea of **giving people more tools to connect through pairing that the existing ones**.

I would also suggest to implement for the time being a TICKET for pairing using something like the camperbot. A person leaves a ticket in the chat through the bot and this will recall the ticket for other campers to see during a determined period of time. You leave a ticket as a *promise* that someone could take in the future (using JS jargon...)."

We definitely don’t want to edit JSON directly - something that exports to JSON for pasting into our seed files would be preferable.

Sure, you CAN do it in XML, but why would you willingly do so if you had something nice so you can focus on the look and feel.

Pairing is good but depending ont he level I have come across individuals whose solutions were so complex that they had to explainthe whole program to me. This while a new learnign oportunity, impaired the learnign experience with regards to discussing and coming with a solution together which I believe is more helpful than being introduced to stuff you never knew or coudl nto come up with on your own withotu more advance knoledge. This led me to use the chat more than pairing. 

This is not always teh case sometimes we paired and both came with ideas and solutions and then we choose the best as it should be.

2. I have got people asking me for help via private chat, the first few times I helped but nwo I tend to send them to apublic room and the wiki so others can with similar questiosn can benefit too.

So I feel that pairing and chatting shoudl go together and not have preference over one in particular. Besides, not everyone has screen hereo. I know there is a tool being developped by one of the members here.

3. mini bonfires or whatever the name is, they are welcome and appreciated it. Along with FCC's own waypoints instead of going to external sites as it was with Angular waypoints, I personally didn't like it, got confused about how much i shoudl complete before marking it as complete on FCC. Having mini problems that makes us use what we have leanred recently besides the bonfires is a good idea in my opinion.

4. Somethign I have been saying in chats, Ajax, jsonp and API ingeneral, we go throught he map and there was nothignt o help us get prepared for that until the second zipline. There I leanred how to get data with getJSON but not with ajax, and when I got to the wiki zipline and that didnt work for me it took me a while to learn from a code snipped on the usage of ajax."

They are concerned that they are not retaining it.  I agree in principle that we need more waypoints, but I think that JUST adding more waypoints will only serve to increase the gap between doing the Waypoints and using them in practice.  If people are worried about their retention NOW, just wait until there are 2x as many Waypoints.

This is where I think that ""blank page checkpoints"" or mini-bonfires will serve two purposes:
1) Put some leaning checks in place right after folks have learned the material.  Force them to apply what they've learned.
2) Reduce the slope on the ""Cliff of Confusion"" somewhat, since they will already have done some ""blank page"" work."

If we have thousands of concurrent campers (currently we have 100 - 200 concurrent campers at any given time), then there will be a much higher likelihood that another camper is working on the same challenge that you are.

Essentially, you take whoever happens to be working on a specific set of problems and put them together. We are already essentially doing this with our various help chat rooms (and I suspect more effectively now that we have Sidecar, though I haven’t looked at the data).

We would have for a camper to use FCC long enough to establish a pattern from which we could extrapolate trajectory. So they wouldn’t be cohorted until several sessions in. This also fails to take into account life changes that can affect momentum.

The first is to just naively grab people who start at the same time and bin them into a cohort. This is how things have been done for the last 150 years or so. ""You were born in 1980?

For example, One Waypoint could introduce split(), the next could introduce join(), and finally we could introduce reverse(). Then we could ask the camper to put together a line of code that reverses a string using those three functions. These Waypoints wouldn’t replace our Reverse a String bonfire, which would appear later (and provide the camper a chance to re-apply these functions) - these Waypoints would be part of the JavaScript block of challenges (which could be broken down into smaller sections, such as loops, recursion, control flow logic, regex).

* focusing on: Quincy was clear about that: ""FCC has to choose its battles"". The main focus is the internet platform and the curriculum (bonfires, waypoints, etc) to learn JS or programming with JS (difficult answer...). My personal interest goes over the learning tools that FCC is developing as well as the external ones. Just the learning infrasctructure that it is emerging is VERY sui generis. Not even places such as Coursera enjoy a learning structure of this kind. Not that FCC is not addressing that: it is just something that interest me the most. My questions goes over the development of an effective **(super) multimedia learning tool** (chat + pair + video + live coding + etc). Quincy and the community are actually working on something relatively new, I don't remember having any antecedents of something like this: an online multimedia learning infrastructure that goes beyond the simple sub-pub format...
But growing fast brings its problems. I just enjoy wondering about  how to grow and at the same time get the best potential of the elements of that learning infrastructure? How to connect all elements so they help the best? etc. I wonder if providing FCC with more data that they are getting now could help to make decisions about where and how to go...
* found your observation about supporting external groups a good idea indeed!
* organically growing: yes... I think that is possible.

Regarding your observation :point_up: https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment?at=5625ac47cb2edb36016df273, it seems that some students are looking for an application or perhaps a simple example lying down the use of some of the bonfires ""in action"" in a sort of ""real life"" problem? A wiki then?"

Here is what I AM thinking we need to do, based in part on our conversation on Saturday.
1) Not mentioned at the time, but the more I thought about it the clearer it became:  We need authoring tools for Waypoints/Bonfires.  I filed an issue: https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/3788 - We need to be able to itterate on Waypoints faster/better and having to hand escape Regex encoded strings makes me want to bang my head against a wall.
If we're going to make many more waypoints, we need authoring tools to simplify that process.  I am asking for this to be built into the beta site or as a stand alone tool (Thinking it needs to be part of the site so it stays in sync with changes).

2) I would like to enable more people to contribute to waypoints and improve existing waypoints.  This means some sort of contribution guidelines and style guide.  I am taking ownership over at least getting a framework together for this.

3) In concert with getting more folks working on Waypoints, we need to build out a list of what areas that we need to expand into.  I'm thinking both at a high level - ""AJAX Wapoints"" and then going down to a lower level - ""Waypoint where you use `$.getJSON` to fetch API Data"".  The idea is that we - Ben, Quincy, and I (And whoever else wants to help) can outline what is needed and then the ""Community"" can help us to fill in these waypoints.

Yes.  This.  Agree.  Also a topic of discussion.   I don't know that we have absolutely clear ideas on what this will mean, though.   I think so many of us a programmers because we have a natural inclination to problem solve and we've sort of stumbled over writing code as a way to express that.  When it comes to the meta-analysis of how we know what we know?  Even I stumble a bit when I'm trying to help someone with a fundamental disconnect.  "

One of the ideas we had discussed on Saturday was the idea of building tools to identify a ""Cohort"" that people belong to - those who are at or near the same waypoint/bonfire level and who are moving at a similar pace.  That is very much was the DataScience type projects are trying to address, and can be used to support those smaller communities. 

For example, one issue we have in my local Sacramento Meetup is that we don't know what level/problem each person is on, so it can be hard to pair.  Maybe we can have tools that would simplify that process in some way?  "

Individual meetup groups are building their own communities as well.  I actually like the idea of diverse small communities that have a core of FCC, but which are almost independant entities.

I can't say much about this because I am not so involved in helping people currently as you are, but it seems that the problem for some students is not learning Javascript but learning how to *program*, broadly speaking. This is important: is FCC a school to learn programming *JS*, or a school to learn *to program with* JS? Two different things... For example: I came mostly to learn programming JS, because I believe I know programming.

Agree with @catapixel regarding the logistics required for pairing. Pairing AND Chatting are both part of the approach imo, without stressing one or another. They both have advantages that should be exploited in order to ameliorate the deficiencies of the other.

Knowing the dynamics of each (pairing vs chatting) is relevant: it is hard to force a preferred dynamic that doesn't suit the media. Pairing is more effective but it is usually one-to-one and there are not a formal way to save the session for others to benefit. Chatting is cheaper, difficult to follow, short, but anonymous, broadcasted and saved in the archives so it could be revisited or copied/pasted. The number of channels is also important:
* helpers and ""helpees"" meet in centralised places; keep in mind that the scarce resource is helpers, so better having them concentrated in few places too, to ""fish"" them easily
* helpers can target different problems and more helpees better in a relatively centralised approach

This is a reason why I am a bit skeptic about disaggregating the chat even more without an strategic vision.

Actually nowadays talking about chat or pairing only is misleading. They must be seen now as part of an overall learning strategy that includes:
* the challenges themselves
* videos
* wiki
* social media
* study groups (an interesting phenomenon...)
*camperbot
* external resources
* ""renegado"" channels (people are creating other channels outside the official rooms)
* etc

Each of those tools has its own dynamic, scope and impact.

I wonder if here in FCC we can envision an overall strategy in which ALL those tools could be integrated, each of them designed to respond to the gaps that other tools can not fill in..."

For instance the challenge for reversing a string... The error handling isn't beginner friendly and can sometime leave a camper lost when trying to do it.. I think a video.. and a pseudo code video should be applied.. also.. other options like... small tests or quizzes your know to make sure people can still keep the structure of learning that they are use too ie: school while learning a new art

There are several reasons why measuring speed could be misleading. Normally it is agreed that to measure code efficiency should be carried out under controlled conditions to make it comparable. But if you are interested to do that for your personal use and learnings:
* There should be a couple of functions you may use to test speed and do comparisons
* There should be debuggers that already contain a timer (usually the best way)

Take a canonical project somewhere and compare with yours. Actually: do that and show your results!"

The console works quite well and due to the nature of fcc I think the campers should be taught how to use it in key places (like before and after an important function or a loop). Right now I think it's mentioned in a couple of places (unless something was added the last couple of weeks) but there are no dedicated lessons that specifically tell the camper were and how to use it effectively.

An absolute lifesaver if you've coded on a branch that's not up to date. Remember to do this before submitting a PR.

* Datatypes
   * Assignment
   * Numbers (Int and Float)
        * Operators (`+`,` -`,` /`,` *`,`%`,  
   * Strings and Characters
        * Immutability
        * Operators (Concatenation)
        * ASCII
   * Arrays
   * Objects (as a datatype)
   * JSON/Combined Data Structures

I am thinking about 1-2 minute videos that hit the highpoints of these data types as well as the operators that modify them.  I would use Briana's videos as a template.
I would like to have the large area under the video for textual content.  It should be Markup formatted and stored a .md on GitHub to make it easily editable."

I imagine if you (or a team) were to come up with an improved part of the curriculum, it would be welcomed with open arms.  I don't know what the exact process is, but I imagine it starts in this channel.  I think mostly you would file a pull request with the updated content.

The process could be a bit bureaucratic and somehow discouraging, but at least you can reduce the number of duplicates (not that you avoid them totally...). Actually, I bet it will be nicer for the person to know that she/he doesn't have to write an issue when someone has done it already...

In fact the usual way to deal with this  is forcing to go through a FAQ, filtering as much as possible before the person is allowed to email an issue, which would finally be handled by an administrator. So if there is some bureaucracy in my suggestion, at least I would say in my favour that it won't be the first time... "

I just looked the beta site and the speed of the images and the size the content is greatly improved. Good job. Just one thing, consider putting a few more line breaks in between the images. they seem larger now but for me, two are are  still visible at one time, and even though the movement is slower, it's a bit frenetic. 
Is the beta feedback appropriate here or should take it github?"

Let's put it in a different way: pairing shouldn't be the only way to learn. It is not... But my point goes further: what if FCC finds that by analysing the data they can improve the information that the people require to solve issues? What if we find that there are other interesting issues? Etc...

The issue is that a lot of people really want to but are embarrassed/self conscious and wont do it for a long time.

* I am talking about the use of text mining as one of the technologies that it is helping large online education projects to get better informed about their services. Most of the communication with students in those projects occurs at chat/thread rooms. Think at: coursera, edX, iversity; udemy and many others... and FCC.
* @CodeNonprofit: I am aware of FCC encouraging the pairing. You still should really **ask if the pairing is being successful enough to beat the chatting, and if not, why so**? (OBS: don't know about how successful or not they are... you maybe have data?).
* There are several reasons you can think of to improve the helping approach to students. One of them is **efficiency**. The other is **satisfaction**. From your words, it seems that you prefer to keep both aside in order to encourage **interaction**? That can... but think also about the positive impact that a well delivered training will have. Additionally, I don't believe that the interaction will reduce, or perhaps the quality could improve: there are A LOT of reasons why people are connecting to the chat, particularly solving **extra-curricula issues**.
* I guess **Gitter is aware of that technology** and it is stepping up to introduce some kind of analytics that would favour the project with relevant info. Can you reveal what for technology is that, @BerkeleyTrue? Just curiosity...
* @BerkeleyTrue The few values I analysed were a quick search over data of 10000 posts. The dates are between 22 and 29 July. It was not planned to be so: the easy way to get the data from the api is by setting a limit of entries. I guess a ""month"" data could mean around 1mil records. Not really a challenge, but... But... it comes to me... what if we make a ""prove of concept"" by discussing a single project to test, let's say, one of the bonfires, and engage in a more proper analysis just for that? We can engage other FCC students with interest or experience in data/text mining (this is the area I have been more involved myself...).
* That's great! But I hope you understand that I am not talking just about a nice-to-do project: I am **talking about PROPER data**, as being used in other well known online education projects... I am talking about the application of data mining to help online education. I have been already exposed to discussions and people working in the field, so it is not new. And that is a good reason to evaluate the adoption of this type of techniques. And for analyses of data related to the chat, I would think in kaggle.com... "

We do not see Free Code Camp’s gitter channels as a replacement for stackoverflow, quora, or any other solution to obtain help understanding a problem. Our infrastructure to encourage pair programming should allow a camper to obtain assistance (once they’ve put in a valiant effort on their own) which negates the need for posting individual questions in a general chat channel. For those who prefer the chat channel, /Help is available.

Here's a tutorial/getting started guide I wrote with all the useful stuff I wish I'd known when I started the basejumps. If you want to adapt it into a video that's pretty valid but I tried to format it so that it's nice and clear just as text. I can also rewrite it in markdown maybe? I just am not familiar with markdown so I threw it together in Pages.

I just didn't see a place where it would come into use later in the course. Expressworks and learnyounode were ostensibly meant to prepare the campers for the basejumps, whereas the test-anything tutorial seemed out of place. There's nothing wrong with it and if it's an important skill then teach it. I'm not familiar with how you guys want to structure the course, I just figured it was 1) give us tools 2) test us on those tools with bonfires/ziplines/basejumps.

Really good course that was enjoyable to do. Works extremely well in c9. One criticism is that the last challenge has an issue in the instructions and you would not guess what you're meant to do without looking at the Solutions. Other than that some of the challenges required one or two goes to complete but reading the instructions carefully will normally point out what you're doing wrong

The last lesson, I thought, could have been explained better: 'Write a tests for this behavior, to be sure no kittens are harmed.'  I thought I needed just the one test to make sure the error was thrown, but I also needed another test for the positive result. I spent some time trying to figure out what was wrong with my t.throws, turned out I was just missing a whole test altogether.  It was confusing because just a few lessons back, they presented each expectation in a list (1) test this, 2) test that).  Maybe it was intentionally vague?  The error results for the challenges don't really provide any info.  ""ok 1 wrong function not accepted, not ok 2 correct function not accepted"""

My impression is that they expect to have to teach the programmer their code standards and best practices anyways, so they might as well get someone bright and malleable. That said, having a portfolio can never hurt

Looking at job listings at least, it seems mentioned more than react-type stacks. But I agree @ algorithms

And, unfortunetely, the state of hiring requires students to be better at algorithms and white boarding than the other things. I do believe we should have alll of that but algorithms will get you hired more often than knowing how to utilize sessions. And that stuff you can oftern learn on the job (and might be ok if you don’t know during the interview), but algorithms is a barior to entry and not taught during actual work.

Are there any helper methods to access the currentUser?
How to launch mongod and the server without grunt?

We are already using Node School's npm, Node.js, and Express.js courses.

We are considering adding the following, and would like your opinion on them.

We're considering adding these. If they aren't total garbage, we'd like to add them. But they could very well be total garbage:

Testing: https://github.com/finnp/test-anything
MongoDB: https://github.com/evanlucas/learnyoumongo
Debugging: https://github.com/othiym23/bug-clinic
React: https://github.com/tako-black/learnyoureact
Promises: https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt

We are considering replacing our current Functional Programming course with this:
Functional Programming: https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop
Lodash: https://github.com/mdunisch/lololodash

We are considering replacing our current Git course with this:
Git: https://github.com/jlord/git-it

We are considering replacing our Object Oriented JavaScript courses with these:
Scopes and Closures: https://github.com/jesstelford/scope-chains-closures
Object Oriented JS (prototypes): https://github.com/sporto/planetproto
ES6: https://github.com/domenic/count-to-6

It will fall in the first 20 hours. It’s only about 20 minutes long.
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2015-02-10T05:50:06.007Z	546fc9f1db8155e6700d6e8c	QuincyLarson	54d99c0e119229eb4eac41d0	If we assume a camper can do 20 exercises in an hour, that means the entire JS component can be 40 * 20 = 800 sections long. That gives us 800 discrete concepts we can impart

One last assumption question: should this be completely insular with all knowledge encompassing the path? Or should we expect that users will need to use Google, Stackoverflow, and docs?

Should we assume that many people are going to need to continue to do their own external learning from books/tutorials/videos? Or do we need to do a lot of hand-holding and spoon-feeding like CodeSchool and Codecademy?

I don't think it is possible to actually build something from just taking that course. You definitely will not understand object oriented programming and the exposure would be severely limited. Understanding the prototype and the this and new keyword will take some time. Most Javascript programmers don't  even understand them.

Distilling courses like that down  to try to make them fit into 100 hours may be doing people a disservice as important things would have to be glossed over, and two, if it's to make things all in one place... if a user is too lazy to click a link to consume content that will be beneficial for them...

Extra incentive could be put toward electives too, maybe certain more “advanced” nonprofit projects are only open to campers with specific or all electives.
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2015-02-10T04:17:46.692Z	547017dfdb8155e6700d6fd2	MychaelZ	54d9866a119229eb4eac4024	I think that FCC students care more about learning practical and valuable skills as fast as possible. The truth is that the vast majority of web development can be done and is done without data structures, algorithm design, and functional programming. FCC's curriculum should be focused on getting people up to speed with being able to build web applications for non profits, not material that is nonessential and for most people a waste of time. In fact, I can't think of real world project that would require functional programming. Now, these topics will help people become better programmers and that's why I think they should be in the curriculum, but the truth is that some people are not interested in learning things that they do not need to accomplish their goals. Therefore, I think that these subjects should be treated as electives and not mandatory. 
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2015-02-10T03:16:05.269Z	54a06c34db8155e6700e37db	brandenbyers	54d977f5119229eb4eac3ec4	If nothing else, I think we need emphasis on functional programming and testing. Neither of these topics are inherently advanced, but they are far too often glossed over for the beginner. It is part of what could differentiate our curriculum as well.
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2015-02-10T03:14:32.474Z	54a06c34db8155e6700e37db	brandenbyers	54d97798938f0fd216cf271c	@MychaelZ I understand where you’re coming from in regard to the seemingly advanced topic focus for the backend. I agree, we can’t jump right into design patterns, but we can structure the course with more focus on these topics so as to nurture a strong foundation. So much of beginner Javascript stuff is relatively superficial.
54d96d6915522ed4b3dbd2ce	FreeCodeCamp/CurriculumDevelopment	2015-02-10T02:55:13.820Z	547017dfdb8155e6700d6fd2	MychaelZ	54d97311938f0fd216cf2667	In fact its not necessary at all i think they should be treated more like an elective

We’ll need to triage.

1) Front end (HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, DevTools) (first 20 hours)
2) Back end (data structures, algorithm design, design patterns, object oriented programming, functional programming, testing) (next 40 hours)
3) Bonfires (final 40 hours)
Together, these will comprise the Free Code Camp curriculum and be the prerequisite for the nonprofit projects."
