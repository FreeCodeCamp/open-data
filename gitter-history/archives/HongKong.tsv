We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

And I’m now using udacity to learn to create android app. I also share the same feeling with you. I believe we both had 0 programming background in the past. We are teaching ourselves coding. The big challenge for self-learners is to set goal and direction. I read some post from other self-learners on forum and think may be it’s better for me to think of a project that means something to myself  to accompish. Sharing our progress with other learners in regular meeting would help a lot too.
