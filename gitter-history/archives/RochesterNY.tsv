We are doing this because few of our Campsite Gitter chatroooms have active synchronous discussions, and about 1/3rd of conversations consist of someone saying “hello” and not getting a response. Most of the discussions are asynchronous, which Facebook posts and group messages are better suited for.
We’ve removed this Gitter room from our Campsite directory. Still, we will keep it open for archival purposes, and you can keep using it if you’d like.
Here’s a short blog post about how our Campsites are evolving and growing: http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2015/09/jump-start-your-local-campsite-with-coffee-and-code.html"

I just finished Ziplines (I guess) and am working my way thru Git.  The thing about ziplines is I am never *really* sure I'm done.  There's always more possible style-futzing."

I don't live in Rochester but I used to go to school there and am now in Syracuse. If there's a meetup or something I would definitely drive out there

The way that philosophy forces you to parse and analyze the logic of an argument has really helped me think algorithmically.  Whether or not I get a job in the field that I graduate in, a liberal arts education provides a great foundation from which to draw in any career!
559ca9b015522ed4b3e39e14	FreeCodeCamp/RochesterNY	2015-07-24T15:28:32.386Z	55a51e8d5e0d51bd787b5975	tinako97	55b259a069ee33730f4432c6	I was pairing yesterday with someone majoring in music who decided the same thing, he'd better have something really practical.  Me: English/French, my husband: Journalism/Science Wriiting.  This is not to denigrate the other majors.  My writing/critical thinking skills made me much better at my programming job and my current volunteer work for non-profits.  I think you will find the same, a way to relate programming to your other skills and strengths.

While the learning has been engaging, the jobs in that field are few and far between so I'm pursuing coding here, which I have been interested in for a long time.

I took all the requirements for minoring in CSC except for the calculus, which I couldn't do.  I was a programmer for 4 years.  But I've been out of the game for 15 years (kids) and need to learn the new langages.  But these excercises are not ""new"" (not object-oriented for example)."

Despite the difficulty of working through these, I feel like I'm learning more than I did with any of the previous lessons.  Actually working with code is pretty awesome.
