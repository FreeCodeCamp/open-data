# open-data

> Free Code Camp&amp;#39;s open data initiative

## About

This open-data project is a [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com) spin-off. Join FreeCodeCamp to learn to code and help nonprofits.

## Getting Started

The FCC open API exposes FCC user statistics for third party applications. The API allows access to:
- User summary list
- Single user details

Note: The API is currently in Alpha test, being hosted on Heroku. The data is an offline extract taken from the real FCC user database. Because of limited resources, only the 50,000 most active users are extracted. Once the API is stable, it will be integrated in the Freecodecamp domain.

### Getting an API key
All requests must have a API-key in the request. In this stage there is no online resource to generate an API-key. If you want an API key for your app, please ask for it on the [FreeCodeCamp/DataScience Gitter]()
