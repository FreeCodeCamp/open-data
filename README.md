freeCodeCamp produces millions of records every month in separate formats. Clicking activity, chat conversations, thousands of video minutes or articles' words...

This is the repository hosting the [freeCodeCamp's Open Data initiative](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/free-code-camp-christmas-special-giving-the-gift-of-data-6ecbf0313d62) that started December 2015. The repository includes part of that data that has been collected from freeCodeCamp's platforms but also points to other similar freeCodeCamp initiatives, references, etc. The repo includes sub-folders of assignments, demos, projects and programs. In general, you will find:
* **Datasets**
* **Analyses** of those datasets
* **Demos** of projects based on the freeCodeCamp data
* **Links to External Projects** involving the freeCodeCamp data

We hope you enjoy it and that you will become interested in contribute with your analyses!
